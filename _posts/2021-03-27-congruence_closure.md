This is a summary of how to compute congruence closure. I implemented the algorithm to compute congruence closure and thought I'd never forget it. But my memory starts to get blurry just after two days. So I figured I'd put things down so I don't have to watch the entire lecture again the next time I need it.

## Equivalence Relation

Equivalence relation has three properties: reflexive, symmatric, and transitive.
(E.g. $$\geq$$ is not an equivalence relation because it break the symmetric property. $$4 \geq 6$$ does not imply that $$6 \geq 4$$)
For example, a binary relation $$R$$ over a set $$S$$ meeting these three properties can be expressed as:

* Reflexive: $$\forall s \in S.\ sRs$$
* Symmetric : $$\forall s_1, s_2 \in S.\ s_1 R s_2 \rightarrow s_2 R s_1$$
* Transitive: $$\forall s_1, s_2, s_3 \in S.\ s_1 R s_2 \land s_2 R s_3 \rightarrow s_1 Rs_3$$

## Congruence Relation

Given a set $$S$$ equipped with functions $$F = \{f_1, ..., f_n\}$$, a relation $$R$$ over $$S$$ is a congruence relation if $$R$$ is an equivalence relation and for every $$n$$'ary function $$f \in F$$ we have:

\\[\forall \overset{\rightarrow}{s}, \overset{\rightarrow}{t}.\ \bigwedge\limits_{i=1}^{n}s_i R t_i \rightarrow f(\overset{\rightarrow}{s}) R f(\overset{\rightarrow}{t})\\]

A counter example would be given $$R(x, y)$$ defined as $$\|x\| = \|y\|$$ on all integers. If we have $$R = \{2, 2\}$$ and $$f(x) = x + 1$$ (successor function), then we know it violates the equivalence relation we mentioned above

## Equivalence Closure

In short, the equivalence closure $$R^E$$ is the smallest equivalence relation that includes $$R$$.
This is illustrated through an example. Given a set $$S = \{a, b, c\}$$ and binary relation $$R:\{\langle a, b \rangle , \langle b, c \rangle, \langle d, d \rangle\}$$, $$R^E$$ would contain all elements extended from $$R$$ based on the three properties of equivalence relation.

## Congruence Closure

Naturally, congruence closure $$R^C$$ would be the smallest set that contains congruence relation $$R$$. What this means is $$R^C$$ contains $$R^E$$ (the equivlance closure we derived before), and any element generated from $$R^E$$ by a given function that produces element which also satisfies equivelance relation. For example, Given $$S = \{a, b, c\}$$ and function $$f$$ such that $$f(a) = b$$, $$f(b) = c$$, $$f(c) = c$$, the congruence closure would contain nine elments in total. First, we
would use the procedure above to generated equivalence closure. Then, because $$f(a) = b$$ and $$f(b) = c$$ due to congruence relation, we know $$b = c$$, now we apply the procure for generating equivalence closure again.

## Algorithm to Compute Congruence Closure

The high-level description of the algorithm is as following:  

To decide satisfiability of $$T_{=}$$ (equality theory) formula:

\\[F\ : \ s_1 = t_1 \land ... s_m = t_m \land s_{m+1} \neq t_{m+1} \land ... s_n \neq t_n\\]

1. Compute subterms and construct initial DAG (each nodeâ€™s representative is itself)
2. For each $$i \in [1,m]$$, process equality $$s_i= t_i$$ as described. (Essentially, process all equiv expression first)
3. For each $$i \in [m + 1,n]$$, check if $$Rep(s_i) =Rep(t_i)$$. (Check if any nequiv expression contradicts any equiv expression)
4. If there exists some $$i \in [m + 1, n]$$, for which $$Rep(s_i) =Rep(t_i)$$, return UNSAT
5. if for all $i$, $$Rep(s_i) \neq Rep(t_i)$$, return SAT

This is an example for illustration purpose borrowed from Prof. Dillig's slides:

Given formula $$F\ : \ f^3(a) = a \land f^5(a) = a \land f(a) \neq a$$

The initial DAG would be:

</p>


Process equality $$f^3(a) = a$$ gives us:

</p>

Recursively merging the parents results in:

</p>

Process equality $$f^5(a) = a$$ gives us:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BDHU/Page_pics/master/posts/congruence_algorithm/DAG_3.png">
</p>

Now in this step, $$f^2(a)$$ and $$a$$ are in the same congruence class, thus we will perform the same operation on their parents, processing equality $$f^3(a) = f(a)$$:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BDHU/Page_pics/master/posts/congruence_algorithm/DAG_5.png">
</p>

We find $$f(a) \neq a$$ has a conflict because node $a$'s representative is $$f(a)$$, indicating they are in the same congruence class, meeting congruence relation.
 Thus the formula is UNSAT.
