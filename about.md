My name is Edward Hu, a Computer Science student in the [SCEA](https://github.com/utcs-scea) lab  under Dr. [Christopher Rossbach](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~rossbach/) at UT Austin. I spent most time doing system stuff and got confused. This site is intended to serve as the dumpster of my random thoughts. If you want to know more about me, please visit my main [website](https://bodunhu.com).


My original intent to create this website is to focus on system-related matters. But I usually find myself forgetting important stuffs after a few weeks. So I often put other hard-to-read stuffs here as a reminder and confuse people. Therefore, you might find words in some posts hard to understand:)

## About the website

This website is hosted through Github pages and uses the theme *Simply* created by Raghuveer S. I like the fact you can add notes side by side with the posts, which makes my life a lot easier. The theme is located at: [https://github.com/raghuveerdotnet/simply-jekyll](https://github.com/raghuveerdotnet/simply-jekyll).
