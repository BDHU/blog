My name is Edward Hu, a Computer Science student in the [SCEA](https://github.com/utcs-scea) lab  under Dr. [Christopher Rossbach](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~rossbach/) at UT Austin. I will joining [WISR](https://wisr.cs.wisc.edu/index.html) lab under the supervision of Prof. [Aditya Akella](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~akella/) this following Fall. I spent most time doing system stuff and got confused. This site is intended to serve as the dumpster of my random thoughts. If you want to know more about me, please visit my main [website](https://bodunhu.com).

My original intent to create this website is to focus on system-related matters. But I usually find myself forgetting important stuffs after a few weeks. So I often put other hard-to-read stuffs here as a reminder and confuse people. Therefore, you might find words in some posts hard to understand:)

## Reach out to me

The quickest way to reach me is to drop an email at [bodunhu@utexas.edu](mailto:bodunhu@utexas.edu). You can also shoot me a message on Twitter [@BodunHu](https://twitter.com/BodunHu). You may feel free to shoot me a text and I will feel free to ignore you most likely.
