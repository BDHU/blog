The first workable prototype came in the late 1960s with the creation of ARPANET(The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network). The famous TCP/IP, or Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol, was developed by Robert Kahn and Vinton Cerf in the 1970s. In the 1980s, research by Tim Berners-Lee gave birth to the World Wide Web, linking hypertext documents into an information system, making them accessible from any node on the network (<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Internet target=_blank rel=noopener>
History of Internet
</a>). The implementation and the evolution of the internet has improved ever since. Today, for most users, the internet feels like smoke and mirrors since requiring everyone to understand the technical implementation will be way too harsh. However, as software developers, they are much more likely to deal with networks sometime in life. This article is meant to unveil technical details of networks mainly from a programmer&rsquo;s perspective so the focus will be put on the software side.</p><h2 id=the-os-view-of-networks>The OS View of Networks <a href=#the-os-view-of-networks class=anchor>üîó</a></h2><p>For the operating system, the network is perceived as an extra device. The Network Interface Controller(NIC), which is a hardware device used to connect the computer to a computer network, is added to the bus.The data can be transferred to/from memory to NIC through two methods: DMA or memory-mapped I/O. DMA refers to direct memory access. The name suggests that the hardware is able to read or write memory without the involvement of CPU. On the other hand, memory-mapped I/O means the CPU can control the hardware to read or write specific memory addresses, which means the CPU is doing the job of writing/reading to/from memory. DMA is usually used for high-bandwidth operations such as disk I/O while memory-mapped I/O is used in low-bandwidth operations like change control bits.</p><h2 id=layers-of-network>Layers of Network <a href=#layers-of-network class=anchor>üîó</a></h2><p>The OSI (Open Source Interconnection) 7 Layer Model divides network communication into seven layers. Here I will discuss each layer and its corresponding function. Starting from the lowest one:</p><p>Layer 1: This layer is the physical layer which is concerned with the transmission of unconstructed raw bit stream over the physical medium. Thus the protocol data unit(PDU) is bit for this layer.</p><p>Layer 2: This is the data link layer. Its function is in charge of reliably transfer the data frames between two nodes connected by a physical layer. The PDU of this layer is frame.</p><p>Layer 3: This is the network layer. This layer is in charge of structuring and managing a multi-node network. Examples includes addressing, routing, and load control. The PDU for this layer is packet.</p><p>Layer 4: This is the transport layer. It is used to deliver messages error-free, in sequence, and without duplications or losses. The PDU of this layer is segment/datagram(segment for TCP, datagram for UDP).</p><p>Layer 5: This is the session layer. It allows session establishment between process running on different stations. Layer 5 is often OS/Library. From here, the PDU will generalized to data.</p><p>Layer 6: This is the presentation layer. As the name suggests, it formats the data and present it to the application layer. It can be viewed as the translator for the network. It is usually OS/Library.</p><p>Layer 7: The final layer is called the application layer. It serves as the window for the users and application processes to access the network.</p><p>Note the Department of Defense Four-Layer Model has only four catagories: the Network Access Layer(layer 1-2), the Internet Layer(layer 3), the Host-to-Host Layer(layer 4), and the Process Layer(layer 5-7).</p><h2 id=more-on-layer-2-network>More on Layer 2 Network <a href=#more-on-layer-2-network class=anchor>üîó</a></h2><p>There are three types of layer 2 networks: System Area Network(SAN), Local Area Network(LAN), and Wide Area Network(WAN).</p></div><div class=tags><a href=https://www.bodunhu.com/blog/tags/os>os</a></div><script src=https://utteranc.es/client.js repo=BDHU/blog issue-term=pathname theme=github-light crossorigin=anonymous async></script></section></main><footer id=footer><div id=social><a class=symbol href=https://github.com/BDHU target=_blank><svg fill="#bbb" width="28" height="28" viewBox="0 0 72 72" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><title>Github</title><desc>Created with Sketch.</desc><defs/><g id="Page-1" stroke="none" stroke-width="1" fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"><g id="Social-Icons---Rounded-Black" transform="translate(-264.000000, -939.000000)"><g id="Github" transform="translate(264.000000, 939.000000)"><path d="M8 72H64c4.418278.0 8-3.581722 8-8V8c0-4.418278-3.581722-8-8-8H8c-4.418278 811624501e-24-8 3.581722-8 8V64c541083001e-24 4.418278 3.581722 8 8 8z" id="Rounded" fill="#bbb"/><path d="M35.9985 13C22.746 13 12 23.7870921 12 37.096644c0 10.6440272 6.876 19.6751861 16.4145 22.8617681C29.6145 60.1797862 30.0525 59.4358488 30.0525 58.7973276 30.0525 58.2250681 30.0315 56.7100863 30.0195 54.6996482c-6.6765 1.4562499-8.085-3.2302544-8.085-3.2302544-1.0905-2.7829884-2.664-3.5239139-2.664-3.5239139C17.091 46.4500754 19.4355 46.4801943 19.4355 46.4801943c2.4075.1701719 3.675 2.4833051 3.675 2.4833051 2.142 3.6820383 5.6175 2.6188404 6.9855 2.0014024C30.3135 49.4077535 30.9345 48.3460615 31.62 47.7436831 26.2905 47.1352808 20.688 45.0691228 20.688 35.8361671c0-2.6308879.9345-4.781379 2.4705-6.4665327C22.911 28.7597262 22.0875 26.3110578 23.3925 22.9934585c0 0 2.016-.6475568 6.6 2.4697516C31.908 24.9285993 33.96 24.6620468 36.0015 24.6515052 38.04 24.6620468 40.0935 24.9285993 42.0105 25.4632101c4.581-3.1173084 6.5925-2.4697516 6.5925-2.4697516C49.9125 26.3110578 49.089 28.7597262 48.8415 29.3696344 50.3805 31.0547881 51.309 33.2052792 51.309 35.8361671c0 9.2555448-5.6115 11.29309-10.9575 11.8894446.860999999999997.7439374 1.629 2.2137408 1.629 4.4621184C41.9805 55.4089489 41.9505 58.0067059 41.9505 58.7973276 41.9505 59.4418726 42.3825 60.1918338 43.6005 59.9554002 53.13 56.7627944 60 47.7376593 60 37.096644 60 23.7870921 49.254 13 35.9985 13" fill="#fff"/></g></g></g></svg></a><a class=symbol href=https://twitter.com/BodunHu target=_blank><svg fill="#bbb" width="28" height="28" id="Capa_1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" width="438.536" height="438.536" viewBox="0 0 438.536 438.536" style="enable-background:new 0 0 438.536 438.536"><g><path d="M414.41 24.123C398.333 8.042 378.963.0 356.315.0H82.228C59.58.0 40.21 8.042 24.126 24.123 8.045 40.207.003 59.576.003 82.225v274.084c0 22.647 8.042 42.018 24.123 58.102 16.084 16.084 35.454 24.126 58.102 24.126h274.084c22.648.0 42.018-8.042 58.095-24.126 16.084-16.084 24.126-35.454 24.126-58.102V82.225C438.532 59.576 430.49 40.204 414.41 24.123zM335.471 168.735c.191 1.713.288 4.278.288 7.71.0 15.989-2.334 32.025-6.995 48.104-4.661 16.087-11.8 31.504-21.416 46.254-9.606 14.749-21.074 27.791-34.396 39.115-13.325 11.32-29.311 20.365-47.968 27.117-18.648 6.762-38.637 10.143-59.953 10.143-33.116.0-63.76-8.952-91.931-26.836 4.568.568 9.329.855 14.275.855 27.6.0 52.439-8.565 74.519-25.7-12.941-.185-24.506-4.179-34.688-11.991-10.185-7.803-17.273-17.699-21.271-29.691 4.947.76 8.658 1.137 11.132 1.137 4.187.0 9.042-.76 14.56-2.279-13.894-2.669-25.598-9.562-35.115-20.697-9.519-11.136-14.277-23.84-14.277-38.114v-.571c10.085 4.755 19.602 7.229 28.549 7.422-17.321-11.613-25.981-28.265-25.981-49.963.0-10.66 2.758-20.747 8.278-30.264 15.035 18.464 33.311 33.213 54.816 44.252 21.507 11.038 44.54 17.227 69.092 18.558-.95-3.616-1.427-8.186-1.427-13.704.0-16.562 5.853-30.692 17.56-42.399 11.703-11.706 25.837-17.561 42.394-17.561 17.515.0 32.079 6.283 43.688 18.846 13.134-2.474 25.892-7.33 38.26-14.56-4.757 14.652-13.613 25.788-26.55 33.402 12.368-1.716 23.88-4.95 34.537-9.708C357.458 149.793 347.462 160.166 335.471 168.735z"/></g></svg></a></div><p class=copyright>¬© Copyright
