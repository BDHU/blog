<h1>Hoare Logic</h1>
<div>
<time>Apr 17, 2021</time>
</div>
</header><p>Hoare logic forms the basis of all deductive verification. To illustrate Hoare logic, we first consider a smaller imperative programming
language <strong>IMP</strong>.</p>
<p>In IMP, we have three program constructs: expressions, conditionals, and statements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Expression takes the form \( E := Z\ |\ V\ |\ e_1 + e_2\ |\ e_1 \times e_2 \)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conditional is self-explanatory: \( C := true\ |\ false\ |\ e_1 = e_2\ |\ e_1 \leq e_2 \)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Statement consists of several different forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>\(S := V := E\) (Assignment)</li>
<li>\(S_1; S_2\) (Composition)</li>
<li>if \(C\) then \(S_1\) else \(S_2\) (If)</li>
<li>while \(C\) do \(S\) (While)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=hoare-triple>Hoare Triple</h2>
<p>In Hoare logic, we specify partial correctness of programs using Hoare triples:</p>
<p>\[\{P\} S \{Q\}\]</p>
<p>Here \(P\) is the precondition and \(Q\) is the post-condition. $S$ is a statement in IMP.</p>
<p>The interpretation of Hoare triple is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>if \(S\) is executed in a state satisfying \(P\)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and if execution of \(S\) terminates</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>then the program state after \(S\) terminates satisfies \(Q\)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here an example, \(\{x = 0 \} while\ true\ do\ x := 0\ \{x = 1 \}\) is a valid Hoare triple because the execution of the statement never terminates, thus satisfying the requirement posed by Hoare triple.</p>
<p>Thus the specification \(\{P\} S \{Q\}\) is called <em>partial</em> correctness spec, because it doesn&rsquo;t require \(S\) to terminate.</p>
<p>There is also a stronger requirement called <em>total</em> correctness. The total correctness specification is written as:</p>
<p>\[ [P] S [Q]\]</p>
<p>Total correctness requires that if \(P\) is satisfied when executing \(S\), then \(S\) must terminate, and the post-conditional \(Q\) must be satisfied after \(S\) terminates.</p>
<p>Thus the example \(\{x = 0 \} while\ true\ do\ x := 0\ \{x = 1 \}\) is no longer valid because it never terminates.</p>
<p>In summary, we can say that Total correctness \(=\) Partial correctness \(+\) termination.</p>
<h2 id=proving-partial-correctness>Proving Partial Correctness</h2>
<p>We use \(\vDash \{P\} S \{Q\} \) to say a Hoare triple is valid and we use \(\vdash \{P\} S \{Q\} \) to indicate we can prove validity of a Hoare triple.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say we are given an assignment \(x := y \) with post-condition \(x > 2\). The question is, what do we need to know before the assignment happens so that the post-condition, \(x > 2\), holds afterwards?</p>
<p>To prove \(Q\) holds after the assignment \(x := E\), we need to show that <strong>\(Q\) with \(E\) substituting \(x\) holds before the assignment</strong>. Formally, we write it as:</p>
<p>\[\vdash \{Q[E / x]\}\ x := E \{Q\}\]</p>
<p>For example, given \( \{ x+1 = n\}\ x := x+1 \ \{x=n\} \), we know this formula is provable because we can take \(Q\), which is \(\{x=n\}\), substituting \(x\) with \(x+1\) given we need to replace it with \(E\), and we will convert \(x=n\) to \(x+1 = n\), which matches the precondition.</p>
<p>Here is another interesting example, given \( \{z = 2\}y:= x \{y = x\} \), this Hoare triple is valid but not provable. If we use the above substitution procedure, it will result in the precondition being \(x=x\) which is always true but is also different from the original precondition \(z=2\).</p>
<p>Intuitively, we can prove the post-condition \(y = x\) given the statement \(y = x\) without any assumptions, so even if we do have assumptions like \(z=2\), we should still be able to prove it, and here comes proof rule for precondition strengthening.</p>
<h2 id=proof-rule-for-precondition-strengthening>Proof Rule for Precondition Strengthening</h2>
<p>Formally, we define precondition strengthening as:</p>
<p>\[ \frac{ \vDash \{P'\} S \{Q\}\ \ P \Rightarrow P' }{\vdash \{P\} S \{Q\}} \]</p>
<p>Now, with the original formula \( \{z = 2\}y:= x \{y = x\} \), we would derive \( x= x \equiv true \). and since \(z=2 \rightarrow true\) is valid, we can now prove the formula!</p>
<h2 id=a-dual-post-condition-weakening>A Dual: Post-Condition Weakening</h2>
<p>Formally, we define post-condition weakening as:</p>
<p>\[ \frac{ \vDash \{P\} S \{Q'\}\ \ Q' \Rightarrow Q }{\vdash \{P\} S \{Q\}} \]</p>
<p>What this means if that if we can prove a post-condition \(Q'\), we can always relax it to something <strong>weaker</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, given that \(\vdash \{true\}S\{x=y \land z=2\}\), we can prove \(\{true\}S\{x=y\}\) because \(x=y\) is a weaker condition of \( x=y \land z=2 \).</p>
<h2 id=proof-rule-for-composition>Proof Rule for Composition</h2>
<p>For composition, we define the rule as:</p>
<p>\[ \frac{ \vdash \{P\}S_1\{Q\}\ \ \vdash \{Q\}S_2 \{R\} }{ \vdash \{P\}S_1;S_2\{R\} }\]</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t show why this is true, so this will be left as an exercise.</p>
<h2 id=proof-rule-for-if-statements>Proof Rule for If Statements</h2>
<p>Naturally, we define the rule for if statement as:</p>
<p>\[ \frac{_{ \vdash \{P \land C\} S_1 \{Q\} }^{ \vdash \{P \land \neg C\} S_2 \{Q\} }}{ \vdash \{P\}\ if\ C\ then\ S_1\ else \ S_2 \ \{Q\} } \]</p>
<p>In summary, this means given we know \(P\) is true, no matter what \(C\) evaluates to, we will come to the same post-condition \(Q\). If you still don&rsquo;t understand it, just stare at it for five minutes and you should figure out why this is the case:)</p>
<h2 id=proof-rule-for-while>Proof Rule for While</h2>
<p>To understand the proof rule for while statement, we need to first understand a simple concept: loop invariant</p>
<h3 id=loop-invariant>Loop Invariant</h3>
<p>Loop invariant \(I\) has two properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>\(I\) holds initially before the loop</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>\(I\) holds after each loop iteration</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, given a loop</p>
<div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-text data-lang=text>i := 0;
j := 0;
n := 0;
while i &lt; n do
    i := i + 1;
    j := i + j
</code></pre></div><p>Here, \(i \leq n \) is a loop invariant but \(i &lt; n \) isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Now, we put the properties of loop invariant \(I\) in formal terms. Given that the precondition before a loop executes is \(C\), by definition, \(I\) holds initially before the loop, we know \(I \land C\) holds.</p>
<p>For the second property of loop invariant, it specifies \(I\) holds after each loop iteration. So that means \(\{ I \land C\ \} S \{I\} \) holds. Formally, we express loop invariant as \( \vdash \{P \land C\} S \{P\} \).</p>
<p>Now, we know if a loop terminates, it must be that condition \(C\) no longer holds, meaning \( P \land \neg C \) must be true after loop terminates. This is because \(P\) is a loop invariant and always holds after each loop iteration, including termination.</p>
<p>Putting all this together, we form the proof rule for while loop:</p>
<p>\[ \frac{ \vdash \{P \land C\} S \{P\} }{ \vdash \{P\} while \ C \ do \ S\{P \land \neg C\} }\]</p>
<h3 id=inductive-loop-invariant>Inductive Loop Invariant</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s not always the case that we can prove loop invariant is valid. Here is a counter example:</p>
<p>Consider precondition \( I = j \geq 1 \) and the code is:</p>
<p>\[i := 1; j := 1; while \ i &lt; n\ do\ \{j := j+i; i ;= i + 1\}\]</p>
<p>We know that the precondition is \(I = j \geq 1\) and \(C\) (loop condition) is \(i \leq n\). So we have a Hoare triple:</p>
<p>\[ \{ j \geq 1 \land i \leq n \} j =j + i;\ i = i + 1; \ \{j \geq 1\} \]</p>
<p>We could simply set \(i = -100\), then if we execute the code once we will not be sure if the post-condition \(j \geq 1\) holds.</p>
<p>However, if we have <strong>strengthened invariant</strong> such as \(j \geq 1 \land i \geq 1\), the new Hoare triple will be valid. Then \(I\) will become inductive invariant because we can prove these invariant.</p>
<p>To put everything in action, here is an example showing how to find inductive loop invariant to prove the following Hoare triple:</p>
<p>\[ \{i = o \land j = o \land n = 5\} \]
\[while\ i &lt; do\ i := i + 1; \ j := j + i; \]
\[\{j = 15\} \]</p>
<p>If we have \( j = \frac{i(i+1)}{2} \), this is a loop invariant because we can prove that:</p>
<p>\[\{j = \frac{i(i+1)}{2} \land i &lt; n\} i = i + 1;\ j = j+ i\ \{j = \frac{i(i+1)}{2}\} \]</p>
<p>If we conjoin this condition with \(i \geq n\) as the post-condition, however, we can&rsquo;t really show that \(j = 15\) is true for the given Hoare triple.</p>
<p>If we also add condition \(n = 5\) and \(i \leq n\), and we conjoin this with the end-loop condition \( i \geq n\), we would realize that \( i = n = 5\), and thus prove that \(j = 15\) for the given Hoare triple.</p>
<p>How we get \(j = \frac{i(i+1)}{2}\) is, however, not trivial to solve, and requires some human effort in program verification.</p>
<h2 id=basic-idea-behind-program-verification>Basic Idea behind Program Verification</h2>
<h3 id=automating-reasoning-in-hoare-logic>Automating Reasoning in Hoare Logic</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s reasonable to automate the tedious parts of program verification: proving correctness. The basic idea to assume an oracle (human or another program) gives loop invariants but automate the rest of the reasoning.</p>
<p>Automating Hoare logic is based on generating verification conditions (VC). Essentially, a verification condition is formula \(\phi\) s.t. program is correct iff \(\phi\) is valid.</p>
<p>There are two way to generate verification conditions: forwards and backwards.</p>
<p>As their name suggests, a forwards analysis starts from precondition and generates formulas to prove post-condition. Forwards technique computes <strong>strongest post-conditions (sp)</strong>. In contrast, backwards analysis starts from post-condition and tries to prove precondition. Backwards technique computes <strong>weakest preconditions (wp)</strong>.</p>
<p>Here, we start from the backwards method.</p>
<h3 id=weakest-preconditions>Weakest Preconditions</h3>
<p>Formally, we define the weakest precondition of \(Q\) with respect to \(S\) as \(wp(S, Q)\).</p>
<p>\(wp(S, Q)\) has the property that it is the weakest condition (least amount of information we need to have) that guarantees \(Q\) holds after \(S\) in any execution.</p>
<p>Thus, Hoare triple \( \{P\}S\{Q\} \) is valid iff \( P\Rightarrow wp(S, Q) \).</p>
<p>Weakest preconditions are defined inductively and follow Hoare&rsquo;s proof rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>\(wp(x := E, Q) = Q[E/x]\)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>\( wp(s_1 ; s_2, Q) = wp(s_1, wp(s_2, Q) ) \)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>\(wp(if \ C\ then \ s_1\ else \ s_2, Q) =C \rightarrow wp(s_1, Q) \land \neg C \rightarrow wp(s_2, Q) \)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, for loops, we might not be able to compute the weakest preconditions exactly because there might be cases where we simply don&rsquo;t know the number loops executed.</p>
<p>Thus, we relax our requirement by computing \(awp(S,Q)\) (\(a\) stands for approximate)) instead, hoping that \(awp(S, Q)\) is weak enough to be implied by \(P\) although it may not be the weakest.</p>
<p>Now, assume all loops are annotated with invariants \(while \ C \ do \ [I]\ S\), we will just define \(awp(while \ C \ do \ [I]\ S, Q) \equiv I\).</p>
<p>However, there is another program, since \(awp\) is only an approximated condition, it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that if \(P \Rightarrow awp(S, Q)\), \( \{P\}S\{Q\} \) is valid. There are two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know if the loop invariant \(I\) provided by the oracle is correct since it might be provided by human and we know human make mistakes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even if \(I\) is correct, we don&rsquo;t know if \(I \land \neg C\) is sufficient to establish \(Q\).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, for each statement \(S\), we need to generate verification condition (VC) \( VC(S,Q) \) which encodes additional conditions to prove.</p>
<h3 id=verification-conditions>Verification Conditions</h3>
<p>So how do we formulate VC generation rules for loops?</p>
<p>\[ VC(while\ C\ do\ [I]\ S,Q) = ?\]</p>
<p>First, we need to ensure that \(Q\) is satisfied after loop, which means \( I \land \neg C \Rightarrow Q \).</p>
<p>To show that \(I\) is actually correct, we also need \( \{I \land C\} S \{I\} \).</p>
<p>This implies that we need to show \( I \land C \Rightarrow awp(S, I) \). In case \(S\) contains nested loops, and also add \(VC(S, I)\)</p>
<p>In summary, to how that loop invariant \(I\) provided by the oracle is correct, we need to show \( I \land C \Rightarrow awp(S,I) \land VC(S, I) \).</p>
<p>To show \(I\) is strong enough to establish \(Q\), we need to show \( I \land \neg C \Rightarrow Q \).</p>
<p>Putting this together, and to answer the two reason why \(P \Rightarrow awp(S, Q)\), \( \{P\}S\{Q\} \) might not be valid, VC for a while loop \( S' = while \ C \ do \ \{I\} \) is expressed as:</p>
<p>\[ VC(S', Q) = (I \land C \Rightarrow awp(S, I) \land VC(S, I) ) \land (I \land \neg C \Rightarrow Q) \]</p>
<p>In essence, verification condition simply stands for additional checks we need to verify before we can claim that, if an approximated precondition \(P\) is valid, \( \{P\} S \{Q\} \).</p>
<p>The verification condition for other statements is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>For assignment, we don&rsquo;t need any additional checks for precondition because if \( P \Rightarrow wp(S, Q) \), it implies that \( \{P\} S \{Q\} \) is valid. Thus, \( VC(x:= E, Q) = true \).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For composition, we have \( VC(s_1 ; s_2, Q) = VC(s_2, Q) \land VC(s_1, awp(s_2 , Q)) \).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For if statement, we have \( VC(if \ C \ then \ s_1\ else \ s_2, Q) = VC(s_1, Q) \land VC(s_2, Q) \).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Quick question: for if statement, why don&rsquo;t we instead use verification condition generation rule: \( C \Rightarrow VC(s_1, Q) \land \neg C \Rightarrow VC(s_2, Q) \)?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is a counter example. Suppose we have \( S = if\ (x > 0) \ while (*) x - -; else \ skip\), and we have given loop invariant \(x \geq 0\).</p>
<p>If we use the original rule \( VC(s_1, Q) \land VC(s_2, Q) \), according to the verification condition generation rule for while loop, we would have to verify the loop invariant \(I\) is correct, and thus \(VC(S, I) \equiv \{ x \geq 0 \} x - - \{ x \geq 0 \} \), obviously, this not true, and we can use this VC.</p>
<p>However, if we instead use the rule \( C \Rightarrow VC(s_1, Q) \land \neg C \Rightarrow VC(s_2, Q) \). The VC would become \( x > 0 \Rightarrow (\{ x \geq 0 \} x - - \{ x \geq 0 \}) \), which is valid, and we will include the wrong VC. Thus we can&rsquo;t use this VC generation rule.</p>
<h2 id=verification-of-hoare-triple>Verification of Hoare Triple</h2>
<p>Thus, to show validity of Hoare triple \( \{P\} S \{ Q \} \), we need to compute:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>\( awp(S, Q) \)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>\( VC(S, Q) \)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, a Hoare triple is valid if the following formula holds:</p>
<p>\begin{equation}\tag{*}
VC(S, Q) \land P \rightarrow awp(S, Q)
\end{equation}</p>
<p>Thus, if we can prove the validity of the above equation *, we know the program obeys specification.</p>
