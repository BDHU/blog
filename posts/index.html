The goal is to correctly predict a given input&rsquo;s label. Mathematically, it means generating max probabilities for the correct label. The probabilities are generated through a process called softmax.
The softmax function outputs a vector \(\hat{y}\), which represents estimated conditional probabilities of each class given an input \(x\), For example, \(\hat{y}_1 = P(y=\textrm{car}\ |\ x)\). …</p></div><p class=meta>Posted on <span class=postdate>13.

DTR&rsquo;s eviction policy relies on the heuristic \(h\). The heuristic assigns a value \(h(t)\) to each resident tensor \(t\), approximating the cost of evicting the tensor.

The main goal of this technique is to bound the difference between systems by setting up an upper bound. Formally, we define the problem as \(|P(t)-Q(t)|\leq \varepsilon\), or the difference between clocks across the network. We will go over the technical detains and discuss what these symbols represent in later sections.

However, many GPU vendors like NVIDIA kept the GPU memory hierarchy as a secret. Therefore it becomes hard to measure GPUs performance and sets barriers to understand memory access patterns, which is a key component to improve program&rsquo;s performance. Here we introduce a novel fine-grained microbenchmark approach and apply to the Pascal generation. Turing architecture might have different results, but the method we used here can be applied as well with slight modification. The method we use in this guide is inspired by the research paper: Dissecting GPU Memory Hierarchy through Microbenchmarking. Here we will explain how P-Chase works and walk through a small example</p></div><p class=meta>Posted on <span class=postdate>15.

The general concept is that the file system provides naming organization.

In a nutshell, it is a servant that manages all the dirty details of communicating the data between system and the hardware in an optimal way which you aren&rsquo;t required to understand so you can go on and do other things with your life.

Even these approaches can reduce external fragmentation and allow a higher degree of multiprogramming, they are not perfect. …</p></div><p class=meta>Posted on <span class=postdate>19.
