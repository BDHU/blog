Since then, its popularity has grown rapidly. However, I&rsquo;ve never actually understand what blockchain is exactly, until recently. In fact, I didn&rsquo;t really understand the difference between blockchain and bitcoin. For me, blockchain is clubbed with cryptocurrencies. So here is a short summary of what blockchain is and why people use blockchain.</p><h2 id=what-is-blockchain>What is Blockchain</h2><hr><p>I tried reading the articles about blockchain before, and it didn&rsquo;t take long before I was completely overwhelmed by technical terms: consensus, asymmetric crypto, consistency, etc. It&rsquo;s hard to combine all these little pieces together and form a big picture. Instead, it&rsquo;s much easier to understand block-chain from a top-to-bottom view. Even better, a small step-by-step example can clarify much of the confusion. I like Prof. Anand&rsquo;s example given in the class slides:</p><ol><li><p>Supposed we own a comic book store, and we want to sell comic books to some customer.</p></li><li><p>Every time we sell a book, 10 of my friends will record the action. Traditionally, we refer to such record as &lsquo;&lsquo;ledger&rsquo;&rsquo;. In the world of blockchain, we call this &lsquo;&lsquo;distributed ledger&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p></li><li><p>Once we sell enough comic books, the 10 records (ledgers) will be collected into a book, all of my friends will get a copy of the book. This is very important because we use duplication to achieve consensus.</p></li><li><p>To make things more secure, all these books are stored in a secure vault. In digital world, we achieve this though ways of encryption, digital signature, and so on. An attacker need to tamper many copies of such book to disrupt our selling records, which tends to be extremely hard in real world scenario.</p></li><li><p>Now we have this secure vault, which is effectively an immutable block. This block (vault) stores the record of we selling a comic book.
If we decide to sell more books, each one will generate an additional block (vault). Each block is appended after the previous block, forming what we call a &lsquo;&lsquo;blockchain&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p></li></ol><p>In essence, a blockchain is a series of immutable blocks, each storing the information of an event(s) whose validity is approved by a majority of other participants. Simple as that.</p><hr><p>I like using the term &lsquo;&lsquo;distributed ledger&rsquo;&rsquo; to characterize blockchain. In Prof. Anand&rsquo;s slides, this graph summarizes how a distributed ledger differs from traditional centralized ledger:</p><p><img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BDHU/Page_pics/master/posts/blockchain/ledger.png alt></p><p>The main difference is how consensus is achieved. In centralized ledger, we have a single that decides the &lsquo;&lsquo;golden record&rsquo;&rsquo;. In a distributed ledger, consensus is achieved is everybody agrees with it. To give an example, we would pay a 45-dollar electricity bill each month to Texas electricity company because the price standard is set by the company alone. In a distributed ledger world, we might pay 32 dollars instead, if every single residents living in the building agrees this is the best price. Essentially, we eliminate the centralized entity and distribute the ability of making decisions to each individual evenly.</p><h2 id=how-is-bitcoin-related-to-blockchain>How is Bitcoin related to Blockchain</h2><hr><p>Now we understand what a blockchain is, it&rsquo;s time to find out how blockchain enables the development of digital currencies such as Bitcoin.</p></div><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=flat><li><a href=/blog/tags/blockchain>blockchain</a></li><li><a href=/blog/tags/bitcoin>bitcoin</a></li></ul></nav></div><script src=https://utteranc.es/client.js repo=BDHU/blog issue-term=pathname theme=preferred-color-scheme crossorigin=anonymous async></script></div><div class="footer wrapper"><nav class=nav><div>Copyright Â© 2017-present, Bodun.
