Every word that serves no function, every long word that could be a short word,
every adverb that carries the same meaning that&rsquo;s already in the verb,
every passive construction that leaves the reader unsure of who is doing what.
These are the thousand and one adulterants that weaken the strength of a sentence.
And they usually occur in proportion to the education and rank.</p><p>&ndash; William Zinssler in <em>On Writing Well,</em> 1976</p></blockquote><h2 id=cutting-extra-words>Cutting Extra words</h2><p>Here are some common clutters:</p><ul><li>Dead-weight words and phrases such as &lsquo;&lsquo;as it is well known&rsquo;&rsquo;, &lsquo;&lsquo;as it has been shown&rsquo;&rsquo;</li><li>Empty words and phrases: &lsquo;&lsquo;important&rsquo;&rsquo;, &lsquo;&lsquo;methodologic&rsquo;&rsquo;, &lsquo;&lsquo;basic tenets of&rsquo;&rsquo;<ul><li>Hedge words: appreciable changes. One may ask: &lsquo;&lsquo;what is an appreciable change?&rsquo;&rsquo; Hedge words intends to introduce ambiguity, probability, or indecisiveness.</li></ul></li><li>Long words or phrases that could be short: a majority of -> most, a number of -> many, &lsquo;&rsquo;neonatal population&rsquo;&rsquo; -> &lsquo;&rsquo;newborns&rsquo;&rsquo;, etc.</li><li>Unnecessary jargon and acronyms. No one wants to constantly look for what &lsquo;&lsquo;miR&rsquo;&rsquo; means</li><li>Repetitive words or phrases: illustrate/demonstrate</li><li>adverbs: very, really, generally, basically</li></ul><blockquote><p>I have only made this letter rather
long because I have not had time to make it shorter</p><p>&ndash; Lettres provinciales, 16, Dec. 14, 1656</p></blockquote><h2 id=little-tricks>Little Tricks</h2><p>Here are a few other small tricks:</p><ul><li>Get rid of negatives. The sentence usually becomes much clearer using the positive construction. &lsquo;&lsquo;Not honest -> honest&rsquo;&rsquo;, &lsquo;&lsquo;does not have -> lacks&rsquo;&rsquo;</li><li>Eliminate superfluous uses of &lsquo;&rsquo;there is/are&rsquo;&rsquo;. For example, we can change the sentence &lsquo;&lsquo;There are few single genes that can cause autism in isolation&rsquo;&rsquo; to &lsquo;&lsquo;Few single genes cause autism in isolation&rsquo;&rsquo;.</li><li>Omit needless prepositions. For example, &lsquo;&rsquo;that&rsquo;&rsquo; and &lsquo;&lsquo;on&rsquo;&rsquo; are often superfluous. This is useful to cut off words in abstract with word limitations. For example, you can simplify &lsquo;&rsquo;they agreed that it was true&rsquo;&rsquo; to &lsquo;&rsquo;they agreed it was true&rsquo;&rsquo;.</li><li>Use verbs than adjectives: protective for -> protect against.</li></ul><h2 id=example>Example</h2><p>Here is an example sentence: &lsquo;&lsquo;Clinical seizures have been estimated to occur in 0.5% to 2.3% of the neonatal populations&rsquo;&rsquo;. We can perform the first elimination: &lsquo;&lsquo;Clinical seizures <del>have been estimated to</del> occur in 0.5% to 2.3% of the neonatal populations&rsquo;&rsquo;. The range of percentages presents possibilities of variance, making &lsquo;&rsquo;estimated&rsquo;&rsquo; unnecessary.</p><p>Upon first glance, &lsquo;&rsquo;neonatal&rsquo;&rsquo; seems like a essential word. However, upon inspection, &lsquo;&rsquo;neonatal population&rsquo;&rsquo; is merely fancy way of saying &lsquo;&rsquo;newborns&rsquo;&rsquo;. So the sentence can be stripped down to &lsquo;&lsquo;Clinical seizures occur in 0.5% to 2.3% of newborns&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p><p>Other notes including <a href=/blog/posts/writing-in-the-sciences-verbs/>Verbs</a>, <a href=/blog/posts/writing-in-the-sciences-structure/>Structure</a>, and <a href=/blog/posts/writing-in-the-sciences-writing-process/>Writing Process</a> are also available.</p></content><p></p></main><footer>Made with <a href=https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/>Hugo ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ Bear</a></footer></body></html>
