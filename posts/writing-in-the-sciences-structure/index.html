If some clauses contain commas, the comma inside the clause is no longer sufficient to separate different items in a list, because we don&rsquo;t know where the boundaries are.</p><h2 id=parenthesis>Parenthesis</h2><p>Parentheses are used to insert an afterthought or explanation into a passage that is grammatically complete without it.</p><h2 id=colon>Colon</h2><p>Colons are used after an independent clause to introduce a list, quote, explanation, conclusion, or amplification.</p><blockquote><p>The colon has more effect than the comma, less power to separate than the semicolon, and more formality than the dash.</p><p>&ndash; Strunk and White</p></blockquote><h2 id=dash>Dash</h2><p>Dash can add emphasis or insert an abrupt definition of description almost anywhere in the sentence.</p><blockquote><p>Use a dash only when a more common mark of punctuation seems inadequate.</p><p>&ndash; Strunk and White</p></blockquote><p>Here is an example illustrating how dash emphasizes and adds information: &lsquo;&lsquo;Researchers who study shipworms say these mislabeled animals&ndash;they are clams, not worms&ndash;are actually a scientific treasure&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p><p>I like the example provided in the class to illustrate how to use dash to join and condense a sentence. The original sentence is:</p><blockquote><p>Finally, the lessons of clinical epidemiology are not meant to be limited to academic physician-epidemiologists, <u>who</u> sometimes have more interest in analyzing data than caring for patents. <u>Clinical</u> epidemiology holds the promise of providing clinicians with the tools necessary to improve the outcomes of their patients.</p></blockquote><p>By using dash, we can connect these two sentences together, whiling maintaining the description on physician-epidemiologists:</p><blockquote><p>Finally, clinical epidemiology is not limited to academic physician-epidemiologists&ndash;who are sometimes more interested in analyzing data than caring for patients&ndash;but provides clinicians with tools to improve their patients&rsquo; outcomes.</p></blockquote><h2 id=parallelism>Parallelism</h2><p>It is often better&ndash;in scientific writing&ndash;to write paris of ideas joined by &lsquo;&lsquo;and&rsquo;&rsquo;, &lsquo;&lsquo;or&rsquo;&rsquo;, or &lsquo;&lsquo;but&rsquo;&rsquo; in parallel form.</p><p>Here is an example sentence with a list of things in parallel form: &lsquo;&lsquo;NASA&rsquo;s intrepid Mars rover, Curiosity, has been through a lot in the past year. It flew 354 million miles, blasted through the Mars atmosphere, deployed a supersonic parachute, unfurled a giant sky crane, and touched down gently on the surface of Mars&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p><h2 id=paragraph>Paragraph</h2><p>There are several tips fo writing paragraphs:</p><ul><li>1 paragraph = 1 idea</li><li>Give away the punch line early. Scientists like putting details, details, details, data, and conclusion, which is a nightmare for readers. Invert the order!</li><li>Paragraph flow is helped by:<ul><li>logical flow of ideas. Less pointers improves readability.</li><li>parallel sentence structures</li><li><em>if necessary</em>, transition words.</li></ul></li><li>Reader remembers the first and the last sentence best.</li><li>Sequential in time</li><li>From general to specific</li><li>Logical arguments (if else)</li></ul><h2 id=repetition>Repetition</h2><p>It&rsquo;s ok to repeat a word. It&rsquo;s important to ask yourself if the second instance of the word necessary. If the word is needed, is a synonym really better than repeating the word? Using synonyms&ndash;especially in scientific writing&ndash;may lead readers to think you are referring to a different instrument, model, etc.</p><p>Other notes including <a href=/blog/posts/writing-in-the-sciences-verbs/>Cut the Clutter</a>, <a href=/blog/posts/writing-in-the-sciences-verbs/>Verbs</a>, and <a href=/blog/posts/writing-in-the-sciences-writing-process/>Writing Process</a> are also available.</p><script src=https://giscus.app/client.js data-repo=BDHU/blog-comments data-repo-id=R_kgDOKZLDLA data-category=Announcements data-category-id=DIC_kwDOKZLDLM4CZrU- data-mapping=pathname data-strict=0 data-reactions-enabled=0 data-emit-metadata=0 data-input-position=bottom data-theme=light data-lang=en crossorigin=anonymous async></script></article></main><footer><p>Copyright © 2026 <a href=https://www.bodunhu.com/>Bodun Hu</a>&nbsp;&bull; <a href=/blog/index.xml>RSS</a></p></footer></body></html>
