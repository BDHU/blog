A lot has changed since my <a href=/blog/posts/starting-out-phd/>last post</a> about my PhD journeyâ€”looking back, I seemed pretty desperate then.</p><p>So here I am, reflecting on the past few years. I feel far more confident nowâ€”not just in my research decisions but in navigating the space of SysML in general.</p><p>When I started, I wasn&rsquo;t sure about pretty much anything. But one thing I was certain about was ML inference. Admittedly, I didn&rsquo;t grasp its full complexity or what compelling research directions existed, if at all. But I remembered reading in <a href=https://www.usenix.org/system/files/atc21-romero.pdf>INFaaS</a> that inference workloads account for <strong>90% of ML infrastructure costs in AWS</strong>. That fact alone gave me hopeâ€”if inference drives such high traffic, it must be, or will become, important in the future.</p><p>Yet I kept wondering: <strong>Is there anything I can do at the model level?</strong> Many systems ML papers treated models as fixed-sized black boxes with deterministic execution latency and resource consumption. This assumption felt limiting.</p><p>That period was rough. Tons of methods for dynamic DNNs had already been proposedâ€”early exit strategies, Mixture of Experts (MoE), model ensemblesâ€”but there just wasn&rsquo;t a clear justification for designing systems specifically to optimize these approaches.</p><p>Honestly, I&rsquo;m not sure how I made it through besides furiously searching &lsquo;&lsquo;dynamic neural network&rsquo;&rsquo;, hoping to find something worth pursuing. Of course, the rise of ChatGPT changed everything, but that&rsquo;s another story.</p><p>Everything shifted after my first paper was accepted to EMNLP. That was the moment I realized publishing isn&rsquo;t as impossible as it seemed. Before, I kept trying to build an end-to-end system, a process that consumed far too much time.</p><p>Instead, I learned that starting with a clear motivation and simply writing it down first is a much better approach. Writing helps untangle confusionâ€”it forces clarity.</p><p>The next few projects moved at a much faster pace. What changed? Honestly, the biggest shift was that I stopped fixating on the future. The long-term uncertainty used to kill my productivityâ€”it felt overwhelming. But I realized that instead of worrying about whether a proposed method might fail, it&rsquo;s far more productive to just write the next paragraph in Overleaf and move forward. After, if you write a paper, there <strong>exists</strong> a conference that is willing to accept it.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll stop here and revisit this topic once I fully recover from the SOSP grind. For now, time to rest.</p><script src=https://giscus.app/client.js data-repo=BDHU/blog-comments data-repo-id=R_kgDOKZLDLA data-category=Announcements data-category-id=DIC_kwDOKZLDLM4CZrU- data-mapping=pathname data-strict=0 data-reactions-enabled=1 data-emit-metadata=0 data-input-position=bottom data-theme=light data-lang=en crossorigin=anonymous async></script></article></main><footer id=footer><p>Â© 2025 Bodun Hu.
