<h2 class=post>Lamport Distributed Mutual Exclusion</h2>
<p>Normally, having consistent event ordering in a distributed system is hard because we have no common clock. Since we don&rsquo;t have a common clock to measure with, we rely on logical properties of time in the absence of clock. Here we use <em>causality</em> replation between events.</p>
<p>In essence, <em>Causality</em> indicates a clock \(C\) is map from events to time satisfying: \(e\rightarrow e'\) implies \(C(e) &lt; C(e')\)</p>
<p>We can synthesize a clock by a simple protocol, usually referred as <em>scalar clock</em> or <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_timestamp><em>Lamport clock</em></a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each process \(p\) has a local clock \(C(p)\).</li>
<li>A message send by a process is stampled with the its corresponding local clock.</li>
<li>On receiving \(M\), set the process&rsquo;s local clock to be \(max(C(p), C(M)) + 1\).</li>
</ul>
<p>This will give us a consistent total order of events in a distributed system.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take Lamport distributed mutual exclusion (DME) as an example. We use scalar clock to agree on the order of access to critical sections. Each process broadcasts a request with its local clock time. Receiver stores the request time and responds with its update local time (\(max(C(p), C(M)) + 1\)).</p>
<p>

</p></p>
<p>A process can only enter critical section given the condition \(W\) is met: \(W \equiv \forall q \neq p,\ t(p,q) > r(p,p) \land r(p,p) &lt; r(p,q)\). \(t(p, q)\) represents the latest time received by \(p\) from \(q\). \(r(p, q)\) is the request time received by \(p\) from \(q\) or \(+\infty\). Intuitively, it says if a process&rsquo;s request time is smaller than all repsonses time and the process&rsquo;s request time is smaller than all the other request time, then this process is the first one to send out the request and thus should enter critical section.</p>
<p>The reason why this protocol works is illustrated below:</p>
<p>
<p class=markdown-image style=text-align:center>
<img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BDHU/Page_pics/master/posts/lamport-dme/lamport-dme-process.png#center alt=lamport-dme-process class=center loading=lazy decoding=async>
</p></p>
<p>When \(p_1\) sends a request at timestamp 2 and gets a repsonse with timestamp 3, we know \(p_1\) has the greatest clock value and \(p_0\) will update its own clock based on the timestamp sent from \(p_1\). Now \(p_1\) sees the response message from \(p_0\) with timestamp 3, it knows any request from \(p_0\) must have already been received, because the network channel is ordered and any request sent by \(p_0\) already arrived before the response with timestamp 3.</p>
<p>To see Lamport DME in action, we use <a href=https://microsoft.github.io/ivy/language.html>Ivy</a> to specify the protocol. The source file is borrowed from <a href=https://mcmil.net/wordpress/>Ken&rsquo;s</a> presentation. The code is annotated and self-explanatory:</p>

# This is an implememtation of Lamport's distributed mutual excluson
# (DME) algorithm.

include order
include network

# We start the module with a 'global' section. This contaions the
# declarations of any resources that are used in common by all
# processes. These usually include:
#
# - Data types
# - Services, such as network services
# - Immutable global parameters, such as netwrok addresses
#
# We can't have mutable global variables, since processes, being
# distributed, don't have shared memory.
#

global {

    # Our first global data type is the type of host identifiers.  We
    # will have one process for each value of this type. Host
    # identifiers take on integer values from `0` to `node_max`.
    # We create the host identifier type by instantiating the
    # `host_iterable` module. It has a parameter `max` that gives the
    # maximum value of the type (and is supplied at run time). 

    instance host_id : iterable

    # Since we have three kinds of messages in our protocol, we define
    # an enumerated type for the message kind with three symbolic
    # values.

    type msg_kind = {request_kind,reply_kind,release_kind}

    # In addition, we use a sequence type to represent timestamps. The
    # `unbounded_sequence` template in the `order` library gives a
    # discrete totally ordered type with a least value `0` and a
    # `next` operator.

    instance timestamp : unbounded_sequence

    # Our messages are stucts with three fields: the message kind and the
    # host identifier of the sender and a timestamp. We order messages
    # according to the timestamp. This ordering is useful in the proof
    # of correctness. 

    class msg_t = {
        field kind : msg_kind
        field sender_id : host_id
        field ts : timestamp
        # definition (M1:msg_t &lt; M2:msg_t) = ts(M1) &lt; ts(M2)
    }

    # A useful enumerated type to describe node state:

    type state_t = {idle,waiting,critical}

    # Finally we instantiate a network service via which our processes
    # will communicate. Here, `transport.net` is a template defined in the
    # `network` library that we included above. The template takes one
    # parameter, which is the type of messages to be sent. Our instance
    # of this template is an object called `net`. 

    instance net : tcp.net(msg_t)
}


# After the global section, we introduce some distribtued processes.
# A process with parameters has one instance for each value of the
# parameters. In this case we have one parameter of type `host_id`
# which means there is one process in the system for each value of
# `host_id` in the range `0..host_id.max`. The parameter is named `self`.
# This means that the process can refer to its own host identifier by
# the name `self`.

process node(self:host_id) = {

    # A process usually begins by declaring an *interface*. This
    # consists of a set of *actions* that are either calls in from the
    # environment (exports) or calls out to the environment (imports).

    # Our action is an export `request`, which our client uses to
    # request to enter the critical section. It takes no parameters.

    export action request

    # Our second action is an import `grant`. This is a callback to
    # the client indicating that is is safe to enter the critical
    # section.

    import action grant

    # Our third action is an export `release`. This is called by the
    # client when exiting the critical section, indicating it is safe to
    # another process to enter.

axiom node(X).sock.id = node(Y).sock.id -&gt; X = Y

# This says to try bounded model checking up to 20 steps (but Ivy
# won't actually get that far). The second parameter say to unroll the
# loops three times. This means that BMC ignores all executions in
# which a loop is executed more than three times. We need this because of
# the loop in `node.broadcast`

attribute method = bmc[20][3]

# Try adding a bug and see if you can find it with testing and bmc. Change
# this definition above:
#
#     function lexord(X1:timestamp,Y1:host_id,X2:timestamp,Y2:host_id) =
#         X1 &lt; X2 | X1 = X2 &amp; Y1 &lt; Y2
#
# to this:
#
#     function lexord(X1:timestamp,Y1:host_id,X2:timestamp,Y2:host_id) =
#         X1 &lt;= X2 | X1 = X2 &amp; Y1 &lt; Y2
#
# This mistake could allow two nodes with requests with the same timestamp
# to enter the CS at the same time. Here's a counter-example produced
# by BMC (it takes a while!):
#
#     &gt; node.request(1)
#     &gt; node.request(0)
#     &gt; node.sock.recv(0,{tcp.endpoint.addr:...,tcp.endpoint.port:...},{msg_t.kind:request,msg_t.sender_id:1,msg_t.ts:1})
#     &gt; node.sock.recv(1,{tcp.endpoint.addr:...,tcp.endpoint.port:...},{msg_t.kind:request,msg_t.sender_id:0,msg_t.ts:1})
#     &gt; node.sock.recv(1,{tcp.endpoint.addr:...,tcp.endpoint.port:...},{msg_t.kind:reply,msg_t.sender_id:0,msg_t.ts:2})
#     &lt; node.enter_cs(1)
#     &gt; node.sock.recv(0,{tcp.endpoint.addr:...,tcp.endpoint.port:...},{msg_t.kind:reply,msg_t.sender_id:1,msg_t.ts:2})
#     &lt; node.enter_cs(0)
