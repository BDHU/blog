      <description>I was always interested by the name &amp;ldquo;map reduce&amp;rdquo; since two years ago when I first heard this term. But I&amp;rsquo;ve never put any effort to know the concept until Chris mentioned it in class because it will be on the next exam so I figured I&amp;rsquo;d better figure out what is going on before it was too late. Just kidding:) But map reduce does borrows a lot of characteristics from traditional relational databases even though many useful and important features in RDBMS are eliminated from the map reduce system.</description>
