without sacrificing either performance or functionality. Xen is type I hypervisor, which directly runs on top of bare metal.</p><blockquote><p>paravirtualization - presents a virtual machine abstraction that is similar but not identical to the underlying hardware.</p></blockquote><h2 id=the-virtual-machine-interface>The Virtual Machine Interface</h2><p><strong>Memory</strong> is hard to virtualize mostly because x86 doesn&rsquo;t support software-managed TLB. A tagged TLB entry allows both guest OS and hypervisor to coexist because it can be associated with an address-space identifier. This is not possible on x86, thus address space changing likely requires flushing the TLB. Thus, to achieve better performance, guest OSes are responsible to managing hardware page tables. Batching can be used by the guest OS to reduce constantly requesting new pages from the hypervisor when new processes are created.</p><p><strong>CPU</strong> virtualization has implications for guest OSes. Principally, OS the most privileged entity on top of hardware. A hypervisor in the middle means the guests OSes must be modified to run a lower privilege level. On x86, this is not a problem since OSes executes in ring 0 while applications execute in ring 3, leaving ring 1 and ring 2 unused.
Privileged instructions executed by the guest has to go through the check of hypervisor in general. For performance reasons, system call exceptions can be handled directly by the CPU. As for paging faults, this needs to go through the hypervisor because only code in ring 0 can result the faulting address from <code>CR2</code>.</p><p><strong>Device I/O</strong> is implemented by transfer data between guest and Xen using shared-memory async buffer-descriptor rings. Event delivery is achieved by hypervisor sending notification to its guest asynchronously. When and whether to hold off these callbacks is at the discretion of the guest.</p><p align=center><a href=https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos/papers/2003-xensosp.pdf><img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BDHU/Page_pics/master/posts/Xen/xen_ringbug.png width=100%></a></p><p>Essentially, the virtualization interface design is based on a number of factors. The hypervisor acts as a security guard that validates the guest&rsquo;s request which would go directly to hardware normally if running in ring 0. The bottom line is the hypervisor shouldn&rsquo;t be involved unless the there are hardware limitations, or when resource validation or management are required. The goal is to separate policy from mechanism wherever possible. This similar to exokernel in that the hypervisor merely provides basic functionalities without understanding higher level issues.</p><h2 id=questions>Questions</h2><p>a. Why does x86 make it hard to support efficient virtualization?<br>b. How does Xen exists in 64MB section at the top of every address space avoid TLB flushes when entering and leaving the hypervisor?</p></p></section></article><article class="post-entry tag-entry"><header class=entry-header><h2><a href=https://www.bodunhu.com/blog/posts/kernelhacking/>Start Linux Kernel Hacking</a></h2></header><footer class=entry-footer>September 14, 2020&nbsp;·&nbsp;12 min</footer><section class=entry-content><p><p align=center><a href=https://www.redandblack.com/opinion/opinion-make-the-switch-to-a-linux-operating-system/article_0b8bb324-5425-11e9-9d96-ab61c820e566.html><img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BDHU/Page_pics/master/posts/linux_kernel_hacking/linux.jpg width=80%></a></p><p>This is a summary of how to compile and boot the Linux kernel on the KVM-qemu virtual machine. It covers how to get a VM running in KVM, how to build a customized kernel, and how to use GDB with the Linux kernel. The experiment is conducted on an amd64 architecture CPU. We use Ubuntu as our testing environment but the steps covered here should apply to other distros as well.</p><h2 id=getting-a-vm-running-in-kvm>Getting a VM running in KVM</h2><p>The Ubuntu ISO image is downloaded from the <a href=https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop>Canonical website</a>. The kernel is downloaded directly from <a href=https://www.kernel.org/>kernel.org</a>. The specs of our test environment is:</p><ul><li>CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6800K CPU @ 3.40GHz</li><li>RAM: 32 GB</li><li>Host and Guest OS: Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS</li><li>Host Kernel Version: 5.4.0-47-generic</li><li>GCC: 7.5.0</li><li>QEMU emulator version: 4.2.0</li><li>Guest Kernel Version: 5.8.6</li></ul><p>After we obtained the Ubuntu ISO image, we use GUI virt-manager to install the OS. One thing to notice here is the default directory for virtual disks is <code>/var/lib/libvirt/images</code>, since my system partition is located on a separate SSD with limited space, the virtual disk directory is changed to my <code>/home</code> directory instead.</p><p>We also create the new virtual disk inside virt-manager. We chose raw format instead of qcow2. Creating a new image file can also be done in command line using:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-shell data-lang=shell>qemu-img create -f raw -o preallocation<span style=color:#f92672>=</span>full vmdisk.img 40G
</code></pre></div><p>The preallocation can be turn either on or off depends on personal choices. After the disk image is created, we proceeds in virt-manager to install Ubuntu on the newly allocated virtual disk. We enabled storage for this virtual machine so that we don&rsquo;t need to repeat the installation process every time we launch the VM. One thing to be noticed here is we don&rsquo;t need swap area inside a virtual machine. We can simply use the whole virtual disk for <code>/</code> partition.</p><p>To start the VM from cmd, you might need to change the owner of the disk image. We add the user to both <code>kvm</code> and <code>libvirt</code>. The image created or accessed by virt-manager seems to change the file owner to libvirt-qemu, which may cause problems when starting from cmd.</p><p>After the installation is finished, we can simply launch the virtual machine inside virt-manager through its GUI interface. We can also use command line to start the VM:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-shell data-lang=shell>kvm -accel kvm -m 8G -smp <span style=color:#ae81ff>6</span> --snapshot -drive format<span style=color:#f92672>=</span>raw,file<span style=color:#f92672>=</span>/home/ed/virtimg/ubuntu20.04
</code></pre></div><p>The argument <code>-accel kvm</code> enables Kernel-based Virtual Machine full virtualization, which uses hardware acceleration. Without this option the VM will become extremely slow. The <code>-m 8G</code> assigns the given amount of memory to the VM. The <code>-smp 6</code> assigns the given number of cores to the guest if the host has multiple cores. The <code>--snapshot</code> ensures that no changes are made to your image during an execution so you can do something dangerous and have the original image file preserved. The <code>-drive</code> option specifies the location of the virtual disk and its format. We will use some of these options later.</p><p>To confirm the VM has internet access, simply execution <code>apt install pkg-name</code> in the guest terminal. No error message would indicates properly functioning network access from the guest VM. For example, when we execute <code>sudo apt install llvm</code> it shows:</p><pre><code>Reading package lists... Done

The following NEW packages will be installed:

</code></pre><h2 id=building-the-kernel>Building the Kernel</h2><p>We can use out customized kernel for our newly created VM. After we obtain the Linux kernel from <a href=https://www.kernel.org/>kernel.org</a>, we extract the source into &lt;kernel dir> and create a separate build directory &lt;kbuild> (outside &lt;kernel dir>).</p><p>Then we enter the &lt;kbuild> directory, run</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-shell data-lang=shell>yes <span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;&#34;</span> | make -C /home/ed/Desktop/linux_kernel/kbuild O<span style=color:#f92672>=</span><span style=color:#66d9ef>$(</span>pwd<span style=color:#66d9ef>)</span> config
</code></pre></div><p>This will create a <code>.config</code> file inside &lt;kbuild> with the default options selected. We then open the configuration file and ensures <code>CONFIG_SATA_AHCI=y</code>, which builds the SATA disk driver into the kernel. That will allow your kernel to boot off a (virtual) SATA drive without having to load a module to do it.</p><p>Next we build the kernel by running <code>make</code> in &lt;kbuild>. We use the -j 6 option speedup the building process using multiple processor cores. This process can take a long time.</p><h2 id=build-and-install-kernel-modules>Build and Install Kernel Modules</h2><p>To build modules locally on host, we create another separate &lt;install_mod_dir> directory for building kernel modules. Then in &lt;kbuild>, execute</p><pre><code>make INSTALL_MOD_PATH=/home/ed/Desktop/linux_kernel/install_mod_dir modules_install 
</code></pre><p>Now there is a <code>lib</code> directory inside <code>/home/ed/Desktop/linux_kernel/install_mod_dir</code>, which holds all the kernel modules we are about to install.</p><p>The complete list of modules can be listed using <code>cat modules.builtin</code> inside <code>lib/moduels/5.8.6</code>. Here is a <a href=https://gist.github.com/BDHU/4d31d18ad106a13caceac4a961d04a44>link</a> to all the modules being built. We didn&rsquo;t modify anything in the configuration.</p><p>Then we use guestmount to mount the virtual disk to a mount point on the host</p><pre><code>guestmount -a /home/ed/virtimg/ubuntu20.04 -i ~/vm/linux/
</code></pre><p>In Ubuntu this step yields the following message:</p><pre><code>libguestfs: error: /usr/bin/supermin exited with error status 1.
To see full error messages you may need to enable debugging.
Do:
  export LIBGUESTFS_DEBUG=1 LIBGUESTFS_TRACE=1
and run the command again.  For further information, read:
  http://libguestfs.org/guestfs-faq.1.html#debugging-libguestfs
You can also run 'libguestfs-test-tool' and post the *complete* output
into a bug report or message to the libguestfs mailing list.
</code></pre><p>The underlying problem is that the kernel cannot be read and according to the <a href=https://askubuntu.com/questions/1046828/how-to-run-libguestfs-tools-tools-such-as-virt-make-fs-without-sudo>post</a> and the <a href=https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1467579>bug report</a> on Ubuntu Launchpad.</p><p>To fix the issue, we need to run</p><pre><code>sudo chmod +r /boot/vmlinuz-*
</code></pre><p>We can verify the contents inside ~/vm/linux by simply cd into it.</p><p>To install the modules we just built, we can copy the <code>&lt;install_mod_dir>lib/modules</code> into the mounted filesystem <code>&lt;mount_point>/lib/modules</code>.</p><p>Finally, we unmount the filesystem by doing</p><pre><code>fusermount -u /mnt/hdd1/vm/linux
</code></pre><h2 id=booting-kvm-with-new-kernel>Booting KVM with new Kernel</h2><p>To boot up the VM with the new kernel, we will add a few extra command line options to kvm. For convenience, we put the scripts into a file. It&rsquo;s also available on <a href=https://gist.github.com/BDHU/8c6ab518ab37571a1cae132d79ac9a9e>gist</a>:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-shell data-lang=shell><span style=color:#75715e>#!/bin/bash

</span><span style=color:#ae81ff></span>    -S
</code></pre></div><p>Aside from the command line arguments we discussed before, there are a few new members here. the <code>-s</code> switch is a shorthand for <code>-gdb tcp::1234</code>. The <code>-display gtk</code> is optional. It enables the opengl context in the display device for gtk display output. <code>-cpu host</code> says the guest should emulate the host processor. <code>-vga qxl</code> enables 3D acceleration on the guest system. <code>-vga virtio</code> also offers good performance in our case. <code>-kernel</code> allows bootloader to pickup the new kernel. The <code>-append</code> along with its arguments specifies where the root partition of the hard disk is and the console parameter adds a serial console at boot so you can see boot messages. The <code>--snapshot</code> in QEMU says the images that refer to an original image will use Redirect-on-Write to avoid changing the original image. The <code>-S</code> means the kernel won&rsquo;t start executing unless we attach a debugger to it. We only use it later in the debugging stage.</p><p>Again, we can verify there is internet access using the new kernel using <code>apt update</code>. There are no errors shown, which indicates the network is functioning correctly.</p><h2 id=booting-process>Booting Process</h2><p>Now we are able to boot up the VM successfully, we can first measure how much time the kernel spends in booting. Running <code>dmesg -d</code> shows the timestamp and time delta spent between messages. The final line shows <code>[10.842998]</code>. If we use <code>systemd-analyze</code>, it outputs</p><pre><code>Startup finished in 795ms (kernel) + 5.451s (userspace) = 6.247s
graphical.target reached after 5.439s in userspace
</code></pre><p>The reason why there is a gap between these two measurement is because <code>dmesg</code> is not a reliable test of how long a boot-up process goes. <code>dmesg</code> itself merely collects information. The drivers and other system processes can output messages at any point in time. There may or may not be processes spawning between those messages.</p><p>Next, we are going to look at how PCI device is involved in kernel startup. <code>lspci</code> outputs the follow</p><pre><code>00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation 440FX - 82441FX PMC [Natoma] (rev 02)
00:01.0 ISA bridge: Intel Corporation 82371SB PIIX3 ISA [Natoma/Triton II]
00:01.1 IDE interface: Intel Corporation 82371SB PIIX3 IDE [Natoma/Triton II]

00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Red Hat, Inc. Virtio GPU (rev 01)
00:03.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation 82540EM Gigabit Ethernet Controller (rev 03)
</code></pre><p>We can use the PCI address here to search for corresponding information in <code>dmesg</code>. For example, if we use the domain value \(0000:\) as query, we get something like:</p><pre><code>[    0.295026] PCI host bridge to bus 0000:00
[    0.299055] pci 0000:00:00.0: [8086:1237] type 00 class 0x060000
[    0.300133] pci 0000:00:01.0: [8086:7000] type 00 class 0x060100
[    0.301163] pci 0000:00:01.1: [8086:7010] type 00 class 0x010180
[    0.311006] pci 0000:00:02.0: [1af4:1050] type 00 class 0x030000
[    0.319650] pci 0000:00:03.0: [8086:100e] type 00 class 0x020000
</code></pre><p>The full result is also available as <a href=https://gist.github.com/BDHU/4d31d18ad106a13caceac4a961d04a44#file-dmesg_output>gist</a>.</p><p>The <code>lspci</code> command specifies the type of device right after the address. For example, the first one is host bridge. We specifically selected the message in the <em>type 00 class</em> format here. The significance here is that the class value actually telss us the type of the corresponding device. We can check the <a href=https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/include/linux/pci_ids.h>include/linux/pci_ids.h</a> for each macro respectively. For example,</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-c data-lang=c><span style=color:#75715e>#define PCI_CLASS_NETWORK_ETHERNET	0x0200
</span></code></pre></div><p>this line shows the value 0x0200 corresponds to a network PCI device. This aligns with our <code>dmesg</code> output as well as the <code>lspci</code> result.</p><h2 id=debugging-kernel>Debugging Kernel</h2><p>To build KVM+GDB-friendly kernel, we need to have proper CONFIG_DEBUG* options set in the .config file.

Therefore, we will set break points on <code>spin_lock</code>. For kernel 5.8.6, we see that <code>spin_lock</code> is defined in <a href=https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.8.6/source/include/linux/spinlock.h#L351>https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.8.6/source/include/linux/spinlock.h#L351</a> as a inline function. If we trace the function, we can see the actual function we should use is <code>_raw_spin_lock</code> defined <a href=https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.8.6/source/kernel/locking/spinlock.c#L149>here</a>:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-c data-lang=c><span style=color:#75715e>#ifndef CONFIG_INLINE_SPIN_LOCK

</code></pre></div><p>If we need to break the execution only when a given program is executed, we can use the program PID to as the condition. The problem is, how do we get the program PID if it doesn&rsquo;t last for long?</p><p>We could instead first set a breakpoint on <code>fork</code>. We can break its kernel call at <code>_do_fork</code> which is defined <a href=https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.8.6/source/kernel/fork.c#L2416>here</a>. After that, we can simply continue executing the kernel until we run the program.</p><blockquote><p>Note: we need to compile the program and open a new terminal first. Since they both involves forking new processes, which will hit <code>_do_fork</code> before our program runs.</p></blockquote><p>Then we print the process PID using <code>p $lx_current().pid</code>, we then use this value as the condition for <code>b _raw_spin_lock if $lx_current().pid == pid_value</code> inside gdb.</p><p>If we want <code>_raw_spin_lock</code> to break under different contexts, we can simply use PID as different contexts. We can also set break points in functions in different contexts that calls <code>spin_lock</code> and see what they do. For example, we can set break point at <code>expand_downwards</code> defined in <a href=https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.8.6/source/mm/mmap.c#L2428>here</a>, if we back trace this function, we will get a series of calls, we mention the important ones here</p><pre><code>#1  0xffffffff81284c4e in expand_stack
#3 0xffffffff813843db in load_elf_binary
#8  do_execve
#12 0xffffffff81b1f658 in do_syscall_64
</code></pre><p>We also added a helper script in .gdbinit to print our the name of the function, which is &lsquo;&lsquo;anacron&rsquo;&rsquo; in this case.
In short, this process execute commands periodically, and it performs a sys call which loads elf binary, thus requiring stack expansion.</p><p>Another example is timer interrupt. The <code>get_next_timer_interrupt</code> calls <code>_raw_spin_lock</code>. We select some messages from backtrace:</p><pre><code>#1  0xffffffff8113b224 in get_next_timer_interrupt
#2  0xffffffff8114d52e in tick_nohz_next_event
#4  tick_nohz_idle_stop_tick ()
#5  0xffffffff810df567 in cpuidle_idle_call ()
</code></pre><p>In short, the is a timer interrupt that gets called when CPU is idle.</p><p>The last example is <code>hrtimer_interrupt</code>. The selected messages are:</p><pre><code>#4  0xffffffff8114d80c in tick_sched_timer
#7  0xffffffff8113c8e7 in hrtimer_interrupt
#12 run_on_irqstack_cond
#14 0xffffffff81c00cc2 in asm_sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt
</code></pre><p>In summary, <code>hrtimer_interrupt</code> is called as event handler. This function is responsible to select all timers that have expired and either move them to the expiration list (if they may be processed in softIRQ context) or call the handler function directly.</p><h2 id=syscall>Syscall</h2><p>Essentially, processor switches from the user mode to kernel mode and starts execution of the sys call entry - <code>entry_SYSCALL_64</code>, we can find its definition at <a href=https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.8.6/source/arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S#L94>here</a>. This is the only entry point used for 64-bit system calls. We can set a break point here. When the break point is hit, we use <code>info registers</code> in gdb to get the value of cr3. In our case, it is 0x22a6d5806. Then we simply step from this breakpoint, and will likely reach <code>SWITCH_TO_KERNEL_CR3 scratch_reg=%rsp</code>. After this call the value in cr3 is changed to 0x22a6d4006. The macro is defined <a href=https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.8.6/source/arch/x86/entry/entry_32.S#L165>here</a>.</p><p>We can see whenever the processor switch from the user mode to kernel mode the value of cr3 is changed. The root cause the Page <a href=https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/x86/pti.html>Table Isolation (PTI)</a>. It is a countermeasure against attacks on the shared user/kernel address space such as the &lsquo;&lsquo;Meltdown&rsquo;&rsquo; approach. To mitigate this class of attacks, two independent page table copies are created, one in kernel space, one in user space. The cr3 register enables the processor to translate linear addresses into physical addresses by locating the page directory and page tables for the current task. So whenever the process enters kernel mode, the kernel copy requires its page directory address to be loaded into cr3 register.</p><p>If we add <code>nopti</code> in <code>-append</code> in the QEMU cmd argument and perform the same steps. We get 0x231466005 before and after <code>SWITCH_TO_KERNEL_CR3 scratch_reg=%rsp</code> is executed. Based on the desciption in the <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt?h=v5.1.3#L3656">linux kernel tree</a>, the <code>nopti</code> on X86_64 is equivalent to pti=off, therefore explaining the constant value of cr3.</p></p></section></article><article class="post-entry tag-entry"><header class=entry-header><h2><a href=https://www.bodunhu.com/blog/posts/wireless_anomaly/>Performance Anamoly of 802.11b</a></h2></header><footer class=entry-footer>September 13, 2020&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min</footer><section class=entry-content><p><p>This research is conducted by Martin Heusse, Franck Rousseau, Cilles Berger-Sabbatel, Andrzej Duda on analyzing the performance of the IEEE 802.11b
wireless local area networks.

When one host changes it modulation type which degrades bit rate, it occupies the channel for a longer time, causing other hosts still using higher bit rate to be penalized. The paper <a href=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1208921>Performance Anamoly of 802.11b</a> analyzes how such anomaly works.</p><h2 id=transmission-overhead>Transmission Overhead</h2><p>Consider there is only a single host in a 802.11b cell transmitting a single data frame. The overall transmission time is expressed as:</p><p>$$T = t_{tr} + t_{ov}$$</p><p>where the constant overhead</p><p>$$t_{ov} = DIFS + t_{pr} + SIFS + t_{pr} + t_{ack}$$</p><p>The transmission process can be represented by the graph</p><p align=center><a href=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1208921><img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BDHU/Page_pics/master/posts/ieee_anomaly/transmission_single_frame.png width=80%></a></p><p>When there are multiple hosts attempting to transmit, a host will execute the exponential backoff algorithm - it waits for a random interval to avoid saturating the channel, resulting in extra time spent in the contention procedure:</p><p>$$T = t_{tr} + t_{ov} + t_{cont}(N)$$</p><p>Finally, the useful throughput obtained by a host depends on the number of hosts:</p><p>$$p(n) = t_{tr} / T(N)$$</p><p>This indicates the useful throughput is smaller than the nominal bit rate and largely depends on the number of competing hosts.</p><h2 id=anomaly>Anomaly</h2><p>Assume there are \(N\) hosts, \(N-1\) hosts use high transmission rate \(R=11\)Mb/s, one hosts transmits at rate \(r=5.5\), \(2\), or \(1\) Mb/s.

One thing the paper could illustrates better is to show how experimental value matches the equation as the number of hosts increases. The average and cumulative throughput value also seems reasonable compared to the expression discussed before.</p><p>The throughput is measured using three different tools: <em>netperf</em>, <em>tcpperf</em>, and <em>udpperf</em>. This idea of duplication makes the data collected more reliable and persuasive, which is especially useful in benchmarking since the results can be sensitive to environmental variable changes.</p><p>The presented results justify the statement made in the paper. For example, the measured TCP throughput for two hosts is shown to degrade as time passes:</p><p align=center><a href=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1208921><img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BDHU/Page_pics/master/posts/ieee_anomaly/TCP_degrade.png width=80%></a></p><p>One thing the paper can articulate more is how this seemly periodic pattern is related to the model. Another concern is the number of device used to conduct these experiments. The number of devices used seems to be much smaller than what would be in real-world scenario. It will be interesting to see how the performances are affected with a lot devices competing for a channel. This can be further extended to measuring performances with multiple devices having lower bit rate, which is more likely to capture real-world use cases. The potential performance impact is not clear given the present measurement.</p><p>The paper also claims the useful throughput strongly depends on the number of competing host. More data related to how the number of hosts is related to performance impact will make this paper more interesting. It may be hard to achieve as many papers resort to simulation.</p><p>This paper has made improvements over previous work in that it studies the performance of 802.11 WLANs, with one host having lower bit rate, whereas many other assume that all hosts communicate using the same bit rate. This is a step forward to capture more realistic situations. Overall, the paper does a good job in terms of proving its point. It captures the most critical information and it&rsquo;s easy to follow the concept. However, the neat structure can make readers without sufficient background to spend more time catching up since the background section may not be enough for starters.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Overall, this paper brings novel approach to analyze the performance of 802.11 WLANs with varying bit rate. It brings new insights into studying the 802.11 standard. The paper focuses on TCP and UDP protocols. Applying the method discussed in paper to a lesser known protocol such as DCTCP can yield more insights into the different protocols can affect the throughput. Another direction is to generalize this model to multiple bit rate degrading and study their behaviors.</p><p>The bit rate used in the paper also seems to be pretty low compared to modern standards. With the introduction of 5G network, the bit rate becomes a lot higher, it will be interesting to see how extremely high bit rate can affect the performance of 802.11.</p></p></section></article><article class="post-entry tag-entry"><header class=entry-header><h2><a href=https://www.bodunhu.com/blog/posts/exokernel/>Exokernel</a></h2></header><footer class=entry-footer>September 1, 2020&nbsp;·&nbsp;8 min</footer><section class=entry-content><p><p>Exokernel is a term every system researcher has heard of at some point in life. However, according to the <a href=https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/>PDOS</a> group at MIT, there aren&rsquo;t any exokernel-based operating systems in active use today. It&rsquo;s interesting to discover what ideas exokernels brought to the OS high-level design and some potential drawbacks of such design choice.</p><p>Perhaps the most important thing to keep in mind is that exokernel operating system architecture pushes management of physical resources to the application level, contrary to what most monolithic kernel would do: providing hardware resource management through some form of abstraction, usually hiding hardware-related details.</p><h2 id=limitations-of-traditional-approaches>Limitations of Traditional Approaches</h2><p>Monolithic kernels usually enforce centralized resource management via a set of abstractions. In microkernel-based system, they are usually provided through some form of trusted user-level servers. There are several drawbacks:</p><ul><li><p>Too general. Over generalizing can limit application diversity and have performance implications (domain/application-specific approach usually have performance improvements, in the cost of, well, being more &ldquo;specific&rdquo;.). For example, in UNIX, two applications exhibiting rather different memory access patterns are subject to the general-purpose OS scheduler and page replacement policy. Letting applications define such policies can open doors for performance improvements since applications have better knowledge of their behaviors.</p></li><li><p>Hide information. This is further expanded from the previous point. Applications tend to have better &ldquo;self-awareness&rdquo; and can implement custom policies that outclass the general-purpose ones provided by the kernel.</p></li><li><p>Limited functionality. Having limited resources in hand can inhibit implementation of new ideas.</p></li></ul><p>However, generalization may not be a bad thing. As discussed in the <em>UNIX the Timesharing System</em> paper, having a generalized and unified yet limited file system API can simplify programming efforts. Accessing both ordinary files and I/O devices is achieved by utilizing a unified interface. Nobody today wants to implement a different set of policies just for character device or block device.</p><h2 id=design>Design</h2><p>Essentially, exokernel consists of thin veneet that multiplexes and exports physical resources through a set of primitives. The libraries, running in the application space, use them to implement with special-purpose functionalities in a higher abstraction level. The architecture is shown in the Paper:</p><p align=center><a href=https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2008/readings/engler95exokernel.pdf><img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BDHU/Page_pics/master/posts/exokernel/exokernel_arch.png width=90%></a></p><p>There are three majors tasks to separate protection from management:</p><ul><li><p>Tracking ownership of resources.</p></li><li><p>Ensure protection by guarding resource usage.</p></li><li><p>Revoke access.</p></li></ul><p>The paper presents three techniques to achieve these goals:</p><ul><li><p><em>secure binding</em>: lib OS can securely bind to machine resources.</p></li><li><p><em>visible revocation</em>: lib OS can participate in a resource revocation protocol. (Keep in mind why the revocation needs to be visible)</p></li><li><p><em>abort protocol</em>: exokernel itself can break secure binding of uncooperative lib OS.</p></li></ul><p>In general, exokernel should expose hardware resources such as disk memory, CPU, interrupts, through low-level primitives with as few abstractions as possible. The resource management policy should be enforced by the library OS instead. <strong>The policy control boils down to whether the exokernel permits resource allocation</strong>.</p><h2 id=secure-binding>Secure Binding</h2><p>One of the primary tasks of an exokernel is to multiplex resources securely, providing protection for mutually distrustful applications. Secure binding allows the kernel to protect resources without understanding them.</p><p>There are three techniques to implement secure bindings:
hardware mechanisms,software caching, and downloading application code.</p><h2 id=understanding-secure-binding-through-examples>Understanding Secure Binding through Examples</h2><p>Secure binding is rather abstract and hard-to-comprehend concept without concrete examples. Here are some examples illustrating how secure multiplying is achieved through secure binding.</p><p>Take memory allocation for an example. When a library OS tries to allocate a physical memory page, the exokernel creates a secure binding for that page by recording the owner and the capabilities specified by the library OS. Essentially, accessing memory resources is achieved through capability. The exokernel acts as a door-keeper that checks the validity of the capability from the library OS.</p><p>I personally like to think the role of the exokernel in memory system is to act as a security guard that protects resources that can be access by the library OS through some form of interface. For example, if the hardware defines a page-table interface, which can be accessed by the lib OS, the exokernel must guard the page table. If the lib OS tries to enter a new virtual-to-physical memory mapping, then the exokernel must check the corresponding memory capability.</p><p>In summary, privileged machine operations must be guarded by the exokernel.</p><h3 id=aegis-the-exokernel>Aegis: the exokernel</h3><p>Up to this point I find it still hard to full understand what exokernel is capable of. Having a concrete system to study for is much more helpful. So here comes Aegis.</p><p>Here is a subset of Aegis&rsquo;s primitives and sys call interfaces that encapsulate these exported primitives. Having a concrete list feels so much better than reading a list of abstract terms!</p><p>Here is a sublist of primitives:</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Primitive Operations</strong></th><th style=text-align:center>Description</th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>TLBwr</td><td style=text-align:center>Insert mapping into TLB</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>TLBvadelete</td><td style=text-align:center>Delete virtual address from TLB</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>And here is a sublist of system call interfaces:</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>System Call</strong></th><th style=text-align:center>Description</th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Yield</td><td style=text-align:center>Yield processor to named process</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Alloc</td><td style=text-align:center>Allocation of resources</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Scall</td><td style=text-align:center>Synchronous protected control transfer</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id=address-translation>Address Translation</h3><p>It&rsquo;s important to first mention that Aegis provides a small number of guaranteed mappings by partitioning an application&rsquo;s virtual address space into two segments. The first segments hold normal application data; the other one has guaranteed mapping and holds exception code and page-table. (Guaranteed mapping is sort of a safe lock.)</p><p>When a TLB miss happens, there are several steps happening:</p><ul><li><p>Aegis checks which segment the virtual address resides in. If it&rsquo;s in the standard user segment the exception is dispatched to the application. Otherwise, the exokernel handles the exception or forwards it to the application depends on whether there&rsquo;s guaranteed mapping.</p></li><li><p>The application looks up the address in it page table, inserts TLB entry and creates capability, then invokes Aegis system routine.</p></li><li><p>Aegis validifies the capability. Upon approval, the mapping is installed.</p></li><li><p>Application resumes execution from kernel mode.</p></li></ul><p>The key takeaway here is the exokernel itself is involved in very few privileged operations such as interacting directly with the hardware via low-level primitives. the bulk of the work is done in the application level.</p><p>Because the kernel contains minimal functionalities, it can be extremely fast compared to a monolithic kernel. However, does that mean the overhead is shifted to the library OS instead?</p><h3 id=exos-the-library-os>ExOS: the Library OS</h3><p>The most prominent feature about library OS is that it manages operating system abstractions at application level.</p><p>The GEMM operation on both ExOS and Ultrix (a monolithic kernel OS) doesn&rsquo;t seem to have much difference since GEMM doesn&rsquo;t use any special abilities of both OSes. It does indicates that the performance gain from the minimal design of exokernel is somewhat cancelled out by the application-space overhead.</p><blockquote><p>The exokernel paper mentions that in the context of networking, the major reason for ExOS to download code is that the network buffers on our machines cannot be easily mapped into application space in a secure way. Downloading the code into the kernel allows applications integrating operations such as checksum during the copy of the message from these buffers to user space. However, I&rsquo;m a little bit skeptical of this statement today. Usually a highly performant TCP stack will be implemented in userspace, along with some polling (DPDK for example). But it will be interesting to compare the exokernel approach to the gigantic Linux TCP stack. The second reason is downloaded code is bounded, thus allowed full context switch to an unscheduled application.</p></blockquote><p>I do find the graph in the exokernel paper interesting. It shows that when application-level message handlers are downloaded into the kernel, the roundtrip latency is almost not affected by the number of processes. Since the operation is performed inside kernel upon message arrival, no handling is needed from the application. This has the advantage that application handler is subject to scheduling, which has performance implications. (The choice of scheduler is the key bottleneck here.)</p><p align=center><a href=https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2008/readings/engler95exokernel.pdf><img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BDHU/Page_pics/master/posts/exokernel/throughput.png width=80%></a></p><h2 id=modularity>Modularity</h2><p>It a natural property of exokernel since the exokernel itself is simplistic. Thus, operating system abstractions can be redefined simply by changing the library OS. Thus, applications have finer-grained control over resources. However, I think it comes at a cost. In a monolithic kernel, applications are subject to general purpose scheduler. Having modular domain-specific schedulers can indeed improve performances, however, it might also leads to multiple scheduler contention, which is not covered in the paper.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Exokernel does offer some new insights into system design. The simple design concept of the exokernel itself has major performance benefits as well as a limited set of primitives which gives much freedom to the application. However, that means the library OS has to take more responsibility. The paper didn&rsquo;t cover enough analytics on more general use cases. The performance gain seems to come from some highly specialized, exokernel-specific implementations of OS abstractions (such as IPC, VM, etc.). The more general case, such as GEMM, seem to be much less performance, when compared to traditional approaches. It will be good to see how exokernel performs under more diverse workloads.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve also heard that one reason microkernels never took off was partially due to the performance slowdown compared to monolithic kernels. Since exokernel shared many similarities with microkernels (seems like exokernel is a more stripped-down version of microkernel since it barely has an OS core), it will likely fall into the same caveat. However, there doesn&rsquo;t seems to have a comprehensive benchmarking trials to compare all major types of kernels.</p></p></section></article><article class="post-entry tag-entry"><header class=entry-header><h2><a href=https://www.bodunhu.com/blog/posts/unix/>Sketch on the UNIX Timesharing System</a></h2></header><footer class=entry-footer>August 27, 2020&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min</footer><section class=entry-content><p><p>Unix is general-purpose, multi-user, interactive operating system, it offers
several new features hardly found in other larger operating systems back in
the day. These features include (1) a hierarchical file system incorporating demountable volumes; (2) compatible file, device, and inter-process I/O; (3) the ability to initiate asynchronous processes; (4) system command language selectable on a per-user basis; and (5) over 100 subsystems including a dozen languages.</p><h2 id=simplicity-at-its-core>Simplicity at its Core</h2><p>Simplicity was engraved into the gene of Unix since its birth, as the paper states: &ldquo;Perhaps the most important achievement of UNIX is to demonstrate that a powerful operating system for interactive use need not be expensive either in equipment or in human effort&rdquo;. Therefore, it is important to keep in mind how simplicity
is reflected in the design of Unix.</p><h2 id=the-file-system>The File System</h2><p>Perhaps the singly most important part of Unix. The &ldquo;everything is file&rdquo; concept that influences all modern system designs. Here is a short description of each major file types.</p><ul><li><strong>Ordinary Files</strong>: no particular structuring is expected by the system. The structure of files is controlled by the programs which use them, not by the system.</li><li><strong>Directories</strong> provide the mapping between the names of files and the files themselves, inducing a structure on the file system. The only difference between directory and normal file is the the directory can&rsquo;t be written on by unprivileged programs, meaning the contents of directories are controlled by the system.</li></ul><blockquote><p><em>linking</em> allows the same non-directory file to appear in several directories under possibly different names; a directory entry for a file is sometimes called a link. All links to a file have equal rights. A directory entry for a file consists merely of its name and a pointer to the file metadata. Therefore a file exists independently of any
directory entry. Directory can be considered as link.</p></blockquote><ul><li><strong>Special Files</strong>: perhaps the most prominent feature of the &ldquo;everything is a file&rdquo; principle. They are read and written just like ordinary disk files, but requests to read and write will result in activation of the I/O device. It blurs the line between file and device I/O since they share identical interfaces and are subject to the same protection mechanism.</li></ul><h2 id=removable-file-system>Removable File System</h2><p>The Unix file system has a <em>mount</em> system request which, in effect, replaces a leaf of the hierarchy tree (the ordinary file) by a whole new subtree (the hierarchy stored on the removable volume). It provides a unified abstraction of the file system hierarchy where the underlying storage components become transparent to the user.</p><blockquote><p>One exception to the identical treatment of files on different devices: no link may exist between one file sys hierarchy and another. Otherwise, some form of bookkeeping would be required to when a removable volume is dismounted from one file system but not the other.</p></blockquote><h2 id=protection>Protection</h2><p>Each user is assigned a unique user ID. A file, upon its creation, is marked with the user ID of its owner. Also given for new files is a set of seven protection bits. Six of these specify independently read, write, and execute permission for the owner of the file and for all other users. This is a perfect example of ACL (access control list) system.</p><h2 id=io-calls>I/O Calls</h2><p>Once again, we see how Unix is trying to provide a unified interface such that performing I/O on different devices doesn&rsquo;t would not require different accessing patterns or styles. There is no distinction between &ldquo;random&rdquo; and sequential I/O, nor is any logical record size imposed by the system. Calls like <em>open</em>, <em>seed</em>, <em>read</em>, and <em>write</em> can be found in all major Unix-like systems today.</p><p>I found it interesting that the authors were arguing why there are no user-visible locks in the file system. The first argument says: &ldquo;they are unnecessary because we are not faced with large, single-file data bases maintained by independent processes&rdquo;. It might be different today on modern systems so I have some doubts on that argument. The next one is &ldquo;they are insufficient because locks in the ordinary sense, whereby one user is prevented from writing on a file which another user is reading, cannot prevent confusion when, for example, both users are editing a file with an editor which makes a copy of the file being edited.&rdquo; This certainly is true because the the copies are separate files with distinct metadata during editing but once the editing is finished then it becomes tricky when the updated content needs to be written back to the original file without some form of synchronization or ordering.</p><p>The paper further explains the the system has sufficient internal interlocks to prevent these situations from happening. The exact details of how it works is not quite clear at this stage.</p><h2 id=implementation>Implementation</h2><p>As we&rsquo;ve already known, a directory entry contains only a name for the associated file and a pointer to the file itself. This pointer is an integer called the <em>i-number</em>. When the file is accessed, its i-number is used as an index into a system table (the i-list) stored in a known part of the device on which the directory resides.</p><blockquote><p>Directory entry -> (File Name, i-number) -> i-list -> i-node -> description of the file</p></blockquote><p>Because the file is described by its corresponding i-node, any copy and deleting operations are circulating around modifying directory entry or i-node link-count field without actually touching the bulk of the file itself.</p><blockquote><p>It important to distinguish between file descriptor and inode. By definition, files are represented by inodes. The inode of a file is a structure kept by the filesystem which holds information about a file, like its type, owner, permissions, inode links count and so on. Other other hand, the file descriptor is the value returned by an open call is termed a file descriptor and is essentially an index into an array of open files kept by the kernel. There is an inode in the i-list but every process can have its own file descriptor for one file.</p></blockquote><h2 id=processes>Processes</h2><p>A process is the execution of an image. An image is a computer execution environment. It includes a core image, general register values, status of open files, current directory, and the like. An image is the current state of a pseudo computer. You can imagine the image as a motionless snapshot of current state of the processor, or you can image as the content saved to the main memory when a currently executing process is preemptied by another one.</p><p>The user-core part of an image has three logical segments. The program text segments starting from location 0. At the first 8K byte boundary above the text segment is a non-shared, writable data segment. The highest address in the virtual address space is a stack segment.</p><p>One key feature of UNIX is a new process can come into existence only by ise of the <em>fork</em> system call. Another system primitive is invoked by <em>execute</em>. This call resembles a &ldquo;jump&rdquo; machine instruction rather than a sub-routine call.</p><h2 id=shell>Shell</h2><p>Shell is a command line interpreter. Programs executed by the Shell start off with two open files which have file descriptors 0 and 1, representing files for reading and writing. The symbol &ldquo;&lt;&rdquo; and &ldquo;>&rdquo; represent what files the file descriptor 0 and 1 will refer to for the duration of the command passed to shell.</p><p>A filter, represented by &ldquo;|&rdquo;, is a program that copies its standard input to its standard output (without processing).</p><p>Command separator, represented by &ldquo;;&rdquo;, is used to separate multiple commands. A related feature is &ldquo;&&rdquo;, which execute the command in the background. When the shell doesn&rsquo;t wait for the completion of a command, the identification of the process running that command is printed. In addition, parentheses can be used to enforce order of execution.</p><blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s worth noting the shell is itself a command, and may be called recursively.<br>Since it&rsquo;s a command, it also shared the luxury of having standard I/O file descriptor. Thus, command such as:<br><strong>sh &lt; file_containing_shell_commands</strong> would work.</p></blockquote><p>The last step in the initialization of UNIX is the creation of a single process and the invocation of a program called <em>init</em>. <em>init</em> have various sub-instances prompting for user login information. If the login succeeds, <em>init</em> performs an <em>execute</em> of the Shell. Essentially, <em>init</em> is the parent process of Shell.</p></p></section></article><footer class=page-footer><nav class=pagination><a class=prev href=https://www.bodunhu.com/blog/categories/2020/>« Prev Page</a>
