I found myself in a position where I forgot most of the linear algebra stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve learned in past semesters. So again, I decide to put them down in hope that some of the knowledge here will stay in my memory a bit longer.
General single-qubit Gates ðŸ”—Trying to understand unitary matrix in the context of pure linear algebra is, I must admit, rather boring.</description></item><item><title>BGP in a Nutshell</title><link>https://www.bodunhu.com/blog/posts/bgp-in-a-nutshell/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.bodunhu.com/blog/posts/bgp-in-a-nutshell/</guid><description>Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) protocol has a very simple purpose: choose the fastest and the most efficient route to deliver a message from one autonomous system (AS) to another. In layman&amp;rsquo;s term, BGP is the GPS for the internet. Many contents here are credit to Prof. Mohamed G. Gouda .
In a nutshell, BGP informs each router \(R\) how to route packets to an IP prefix \(pf\) (i.e. block of IP addresses) that is used in \(AS_i\) different from \(AS_j\), where \(R\) is located:</description></item><item><title>From Autotools to CMake</title><link>https://www.bodunhu.com/blog/posts/from-autotools-to-cmake/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.bodunhu.com/blog/posts/from-autotools-to-cmake/</guid><description>Since my paper on GPU benchmarking was published, every once in a while, I got emails asking me why Altis doesn&amp;rsquo;t build on their platforms. It almost always has something to do a small script which is responsible for finding CUDA dependencies. This script is invoked every single time make is executed. For some reason, the regular expression in the script sometimes breaks randomly, depending on the Linux distro, the kernel version, the host architecture, or even the CUDA version.</description></item><item><title>How SAT Solver works</title><link>https://www.bodunhu.com/blog/posts/how-sat-solver-works/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.bodunhu.com/blog/posts/how-sat-solver-works/</guid><description>This is a summary over the high-level design of &lt;a

I often think, what if we write programs in a verification language, would there be much less bugs and will it make our lives much easier than sitting in front a screen for hours grinding at bugs.</description></item><item><title>Ethereum</title><link>https://www.bodunhu.com/blog/posts/ethereum/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.bodunhu.com/blog/posts/ethereum/</guid><description>In my previous &lt;a

Now that the semester has ended, I decided to put down some reflections on this process. This post is not intended to be the most comprehensive CS Ph.D. application tutorial in the world, but merely a half-guide half-memoir of journey towards a PhD. Of course, you should take this post with a grain of salt, since I don&amp;rsquo;t work on admission committees, and am no where near an expert in the application process</description></item><item><title>Blockchain</title><link>https://www.bodunhu.com/blog/posts/blockchain/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.bodunhu.com/blog/posts/blockchain/</guid><description>The first time I&amp;rsquo;ve heard the term &amp;lsquo;&amp;lsquo;blockchain&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; was around 2014. Since then, its popularity has grown rapidly. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve never actually understand what blockchain is exactly, until recently. In fact, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really understand the difference between blockchain and bitcoin. For me, blockchain is clubbed with cryptocurrencies. So here is a short summary of what blockchain is and why people use blockchain</description></item><item><title>Hoare Logic</title><link>https://www.bodunhu.com/blog/posts/hoare-logic/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.bodunhu.com/blog/posts/hoare-logic/</guid><description>Hoare logic forms the basis of all deductive verification.

I implemented the algorithm to compute congruence closure and thought I&amp;rsquo;d never forget it. But my memory starts to get blurry just after two days.
