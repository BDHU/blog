      <title>Memory Resource Management in VMware ESX Server</title>

      <description>VMWare ESX Server is a software layer designed to multiplex hardware resources among virtual machines running unmodified commodity operating systems. ESX Server, different to VMware Workstation, is a type 1 hypervisor, which means it runs directly on bare metal. ESX Server focuses on running guest VMs without modifying the guest OSes at all, which is challenging.
  Memory Virtualization is done by interposing an extra abstraction layer between a physical address from the VM&amp;rsquo;s point of view, and a machine address which represents the actual hardware memory.</description>

      <description>Xen is an x86 virtual machine monitor which allows multiple commodity operating systems to share conventional hardware in a safe and resource managed fashion, without sacrificing either performance or functionality. Xen is type I hypervisor, which directly runs on top of bare metal.
 paravirtualization - presents a virtual machine abstraction that is similar but not identical to the underlying hardware.
  The Virtual Machine Interface Memory is hard to virtualize mostly because x86 doesn&amp;rsquo;t support software-managed TLB.</description>
