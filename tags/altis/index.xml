It almost always has something to do a small script which is responsible for finding CUDA dependencies. This script is invoked every single time make is executed. For some reason, the regular expression in the script sometimes breaks randomly, depending on the Linux distro, the kernel version, the host architecture, or even the CUDA version.</description></item></channel></rss>
