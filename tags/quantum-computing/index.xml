Many of them boiled down to &amp;lsquo;&amp;lsquo;the state of a qubit is 0, 1, or 0 and 1 at the same time&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;. This statement leads to both confusion and misinterpretation. The explanation I found on Quantum computing for the very curious is by far the most elegant and simplest:
The state of a qubit is a vector in a two-dimensional vector space.</description></item><item><title>Unitary Matrix</title><link>https://www.bodunhu.com/blog/posts/unitary-matrix/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.bodunhu.com/blog/posts/unitary-matrix/</guid><description>Recently, I was trying to get the hang of quantum computing. I found myself in a position where I forgot most of the linear algebra stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve learned in past semesters. So again, I decide to put them down in hope that some of the knowledge here will stay in my memory a bit longer</description></item></channel></rss>
