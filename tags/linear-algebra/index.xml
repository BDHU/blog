I found myself in a position where I forgot most of the linear algebra stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve learned in past semesters. So again, I decide to put them down in hope that some of the knowledge here will stay in my memory a bit longer.
General single-qubit Gates ðŸ”—Trying to understand unitary matrix in the context of pure linear algebra is, I must admit, rather boring.</description></item><item><title>Singular Value Decomposition</title><link>https://www.bodunhu.com/blog/posts/singular-value-decomposition/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.bodunhu.com/blog/posts/singular-value-decomposition/</guid><description>Unitary matrices and the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) are two important concepts in linear algebra. In order to fully understand these concepts, we will need to first discuss orthogonality. Most materials are converted in Advanced Linear Algebra: Foundations to Frontiers taught by professor &lt;a
