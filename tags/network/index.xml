In layman&amp;rsquo;s term, BGP is the GPS for the internet. Many contents here are credit to Prof. Mohamed G. Gouda.
In a nutshell, BGP informs each router \(R\) how to route packets to an IP prefix \(pf\) (i.e. block of IP addresses) that is used in \(AS_i\) different from \(AS_j\), where \(R\) is located:</description></item><item><title>Networks</title><link>https://www.bodunhu.com/blog/posts/networks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.bodunhu.com/blog/posts/networks/</guid><description>The concept of a worldwide of networks of information was introduced long before the technology used to build the internet. The first workable prototype came in the late 1960s with the creation of ARPANET(The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network). The famous TCP/IP, or Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol, was developed by Robert Kahn and Vinton Cerf in the 1970s. In the 1980s, research by Tim Berners-Lee gave birth to the World Wide Web, linking hypertext documents into an information system, making them accessible from any node on the network (History of Internet).</description></item></channel></rss>
