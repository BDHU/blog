Since then, its popularity has grown rapidly. However, I&rsquo;ve never actually understand what blockchain is exactly, until recently. In fact, I didn&rsquo;t really understand the difference between blockchain and bitcoin. For me, blockchain is clubbed with cryptocurrencies. So here is a short summary of what blockchain is and why people use blockchain.</p><h2 id=what-is-blockchain>What is Blockchain</h2><p>I tried reading the articles about blockchain before, and it didn&rsquo;t take long before I was completely overwhelmed by technical terms: consensus, asymmetric crypto, consistency, etc. It&rsquo;s hard to combine all these little pieces together and form a big picture. Instead, it&rsquo;s much easier to understand block-chain from a top-to-bottom view. Even better, a small step-by-step example can clarify much of the confusion. I like Prof. Anand&rsquo;s example given in the class slides:</p><ul><li><p>Supposed we own a comic book store, and we want to sell comic books to some customer.</p></li><li><p>Every time we sell a book, 10 of my friends will record the action. Traditionally, we refer to such record as &lsquo;&lsquo;ledger&rsquo;&rsquo;. In the world of blockchain, we call this &lsquo;&lsquo;distributed ledger&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p></li><li><p>Once we sell enough comic books, the 10 records (ledgers) will be collected into a book, all of my friends will get a copy of the book. This is very important because we use duplication to achieve consensus.</p></li><li><p>To make things more secure, all these books are stored in a secure vault. In digital world, we achieve this though ways of encryption, digital signature, and so on. An attacker need to tamper many copies of such book to disrupt our selling records, which tends to be extremely hard in real world scenario.</p></li><li><p>Now we have this secure vault, which is effectively an immutable block. This block (vault) stores the record of we selling a comic book.
If we decide to sell more books, each one will generate an additional block (vault). Each block is appended after the previous block, forming what we call a &lsquo;&lsquo;blockchain&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p></li></ul><p>In essence, a blockchain is a series of immutable blocks, each storing the information of an event(s) whose validity is approved by a majority of other participants. Simple as that.</p><p>I like using the term &lsquo;&lsquo;distributed ledger&rsquo;&rsquo; to characterize blockchain. In Prof. Anand&rsquo;s slides, this graph summarizes how a distributed ledger differs from traditional centralized ledger:</p><p><img loading=lazy src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BDHU/Page_pics/master/posts/blockchain/ledger.png alt></p><p>The main difference is how consensus is achieved. In centralized ledger, we have a single that decides the &lsquo;&lsquo;golden record&rsquo;&rsquo;. In a distributed ledger, consensus is achieved is everybody agrees with it. To give an example, we would pay a 45-dollar electricity bill each month to Texas electricity company because the price standard is set by the company alone. In a distributed ledger world, we might pay 32 dollars instead, if every single residents living in the building agrees this is the best price. Essentially, we eliminate the centralized entity and distribute the ability of making decisions to each individual evenly.</p><p>In super-simple terms, a blockchain is just a computer file for storing data. The reason why it&rsquo;s so secure is because there doesn&rsquo;t exist a single central point of attack for hackers to target.</p><h2 id=how-is-bitcoin-related-to-blockchain>How is Bitcoin related to Blockchain</h2><p>Now we understand what a blockchain is, it&rsquo;s time to find out how blockchain enables the development of digital currencies such as Bitcoin.
There are many great articles talking about Bitcoin in details, but I found the original <a href=https://nakamotoinstitute.org/bitcoin/>paper</a> extremely helpful in terms of understanding the motivation behind Bitcoin. In essence, Bitcoin was introduced to eliminate one problem: the need of a trusted third party to process electronic payments. More abstractly, shift from trust-based system to cryptographic-proof-based system.</p><p>Tha paper claims that trust based model suffers from a fundamental weakness: the need of mediation. The logic is simple: mediation is required in the presence of disputes. Disputes means making non-reversible transactions more difficult, thus comes the possibility of reversal. Reversal causes the need for trust to spread. To establish trust, more price needs to be paid, in the form of money, personal information, etc. Essentially, the need of trust creates a centralized component that participants must rely on. In theory, Bitcoin resorts to a cryptographic-proof based system to replace the trust-based system, with the difference being that cryptographic-proof based system is distributed in nature.</p><p>Imaging a distributed system as a fully connected graph with \(n\) nodes where each node represents a buyer/buyer. A transaction represents an edge connecting two nodes together. We denote set \(T\) as currently ongoing transactions, there could be as many as \(n(n-1)\) transactions going on concurrently, and each transaction \(t \in T\) is independent to each other. There enables 1) extremely scalability; 2) on reliance on central components. If a transaction is committed to a Bitcoin network, it suggests that the transaction has already gained approval from both the buyer and seller side (why this is the case is more technical, and you should Google how symmetric and asymmetric encryption work).</p><p>If we imaging a centralized system, where every buyer node is connected to one node \(c\). Node \(c\) in turn is connected to every seller node \(s\). Assume the centralized component, or node \(c\), has a fixed capacity limiting the amount of traffic flowing thought it in any given moment. To achieve the same level of information flow in a distributed system, we need to increase node \(c\)&rsquo;s capacity, which represents the increased costs of mediation. Assume a buyer node \(b\)&rsquo;s output value is different from a seller node \(s\)&rsquo;s input value (disputes), extra information flow will be required from seller node \(s\), creating the need for more capacity at node \(c\), thus driving the cost.</p><p>From an abstract point of view, I&rsquo;d like to imaging a normal transaction in a Bitcoin network as follows:</p><ol><li><p>Transaction is initiated</p></li><li><p>The buy, the seller, and all witnesses agree with the validity of such transaction.</p></li><li><p>With everyone satisfied as the precondition, transaction completes. If there exists a disagreement, transaction doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p></li></ol><p>On the other hand, in a centralized system, the transaction happens as follows:</p><ol><li><p>Transaction is initiated</p></li><li><p>Seller received payments, but there&rsquo;s a mismatch</p></li><li><p>Now the centralized component must be engaged to mitigate the issue.</p></li><li><p>More shit happens, the centralized component must constantly nag both the buyer and the seller until the problem is solved.</p></li></ol><p>Until I find better terms to capture my thoughts, I would put these two types of transactions into two different catagories: condition-oriented and process-oriented. Condition-oriented (Bitcoin) means we can achieve global optimum (in our case, a successful transaction) if a precondition is met (consensus). Process-oriented (Centralized) means, instead of agreeing on a precondition, we achieve global optimum through constant trial and error, which comes at a cost of disputes.</p><p>In short, I think trust is not &lsquo;&lsquo;removed&rsquo;&rsquo;, it is merely achieved through a different way. I&rsquo;d like to modify Prof. Anand&rsquo;s summary on Bitcoin: Bitcoin is an engineering solution to solve trust issues.</p></p></section></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2021 <a href=https://www.bodunhu.com/blog/>std::bodun::blog</a></span>
