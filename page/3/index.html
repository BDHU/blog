Writing Process The writing process includes three steps:
Prewriting Collect and organize information Brainstorm take-home messages Work out ideas away from the computer Develop a road map Writing the first draft Putting ideas together in organized prose Revision Read out loud Cut the clutter Verb check Get feedback A lot of people often convolute step 2 and 3. â€¦</p></div><p class=meta>Posted on <span class=postdate>09.

The secret of good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components. Every word that serves no function, every long word that could be a short word, every adverb that carries the same meaning that&rsquo;s already in the verb, every passive construction that leaves the reader unsure of who is doing what. â€¦</p></div><p class=meta>Posted on <span class=postdate>30.

In layman&rsquo;s term, BGP is the GPS for the internet. Many contents here are credit to Prof. Mohamed G. Gouda.
In a nutshell, BGP informs each router \(R\) how to route packets to an IP prefix \(pf\) (i.e. block of IP addresses) that is used in \(AS_i\) different from \(AS_j\), where \(R\) is located: â€¦</p></div><p class=meta>Posted on <span class=postdate>06.

It almost always has something to do a small script which is responsible for finding CUDA dependencies. This script is invoked every single time make is executed. For some reason, the regular expression in the script sometimes breaks randomly, depending on the Linux distro, the kernel version, the host architecture, or even the CUDA version. â€¦</p></div><p class=meta>Posted on <span class=postdate>21.
