The secret of good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components. Every word that serves no function, every long word that could be a short word, every adverb that carries the same meaning that&rsquo;s already in the verb, every passive construction that leaves the reader unsure of who is doing what. …</p></div><p class=meta>Posted on <span class=postdate>30.

In a nutshell, BGP informs each router \(R\) how to route packets to an IP prefix \(pf\) (i.e. block of IP addresses) that is used in \(AS_i\) different from \(AS_j\), where \(R\) is located: …</p></div><p class=meta>Posted on <span class=postdate>06.
