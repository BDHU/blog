ESX Server, different to VMware Workstation, is a type 1 hypervisor, which means it runs directly on bare metal. ESX Server focuses on running guest VMs without modifying the guest OSes at all, which is challenging.
Memory Virtualization is done by interposing an extra abstraction layer between a physical address from the VM&rsquo;s point of view, and a machine address which represents the actual hardware memory. â€¦</p></div><p class=meta>Posted on <span class=postdate>21.

Xen is type I hypervisor, which directly runs on top of bare metal. We will summarize what Xen is what its attributes are.

The main goal of this technique is to bound the difference between systems by setting up an upper bound. Formally, we define the problem as \(|P(t)-Q(t)|\leq \varepsilon\), or the difference between clocks across the network. We will go over the technical detains and discuss what these symbols represent in later sections. Most of these materials are from Prof. Mok&rsquo;s slides on dependable systems classes. â€¦</p></div><p class=meta>Posted on <span class=postdate>17.
