I thought it would be as simple as submitting the pdf file, which should take approximately less than ten minutes. I was wrong. It took several hours to figure what was going on. I included some tips here to prevent mistakes I made from happening again..</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/blog/posts/a-little-review-on-barrelfish-memory-management/>A Little Review on Barrelfish Memory Management</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2019-02-18 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Feb 18, 2019</time></div></div><div class=summary>The memory management has been mentioned numerous times and still remains huge topic. virtual vs. physical memory, physical frame allocation, MMUs, page faults, address space layout, and demand paging and swapping are familiar terms for every undergrad in college. In monolithic kernels such as Linux, much of the functionality is handled in kernel. However, there are OSes, such as Barrelfish, that takes a different approach by pushing these functionalities to user space...</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/blog/posts/pascal-gpu-memory-and-cache-hierarchy/>Pascal GPU memory and cache hierarchy</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2019-01-15 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Jan 15, 2019</time></div></div><div class=summary>Memory access efﬁciency is an important factor in fully utilizing the computational power of graphics processing units (GPUs). However, many GPU vendors like NVIDIA kept the GPU memory hierarchy as a secret. Therefore it becomes hard to measure GPUs performance and sets barriers to understand memory access patterns, which is a key component to improve program’s performance. Here we introduce a novel fine-grained microbenchmark approach and apply to the Pascal generation. Turing architecture might have different results, but the method we used here can be applied as well with slight modification. The method we use in this guide is inspired by the research paper: Dissecting GPU Memory Hierarchy through Microbenchmarking. Here we will explain how P-Chase works and walk through a small example..</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/blog/posts/map-reduce/>Map Reduce</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2018-04-01 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Apr 1, 2018</time></div></div><div class=summary>I was always interested by the name ‘‘map reduce’’ since two years ago when I first heard this term. But I’ve never put any effort to know the concept until Chris mentioned it in class because it will be on the next exam so I figured I’d better figure out what is going on before it was too late. Just kidding:) But map reduce does borrows a lot of characteristics from traditional relational databases even though many useful and important features in RDBMS are eliminated from the map reduce system. You can check this long list of roasts on map reduce here..</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/blog/posts/networks/>Networks</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2017-11-13 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Nov 13, 2017</time></div></div><div class=summary>The concept of a worldwide of networks of information was introduced long before the technology used to build the internet. The first workable prototype came in the late 1960s with the creation of ARPANET(The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network). The famous TCP/IP, or Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol, was developed by Robert Kahn and Vinton Cerf in the 1970s. In the 1980s, research by Tim Berners-Lee gave birth to the World Wide Web, linking hypertext documents into an information system, making them accessible from any node on the network (History of Internet)...</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/blog/posts/file-system-design/>File System Design</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2017-10-30 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Oct 30, 2017</time></div></div><div class=summary>What exactly is a file system? The general concept is that the file system provides naming organization. It manages the physical disk layout such as picking a block constituting a file, balancing locality with expandability, and managing free space. It can translate from file name and offset to the actual data block. In a nutshell, it is a servant that manages all the dirty details of communicating the data between system and the hardware in an optimal way which you aren’t required to understand so you can go on and do other things with your life. So what are the functionalities of file systems? In general, it provides file name organizations such as directories. It can manage disk layout by picking blocks that constitute a file, balancing locality with expandability, and manage free space. It can translate from file name and offset to the actual data block..</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/blog/posts/disk-introduction/>Disk Introduction</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2017-10-25 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Oct 25, 2017</time></div></div><div class=summary>This chapter is all about disk.

We won’t go deep into the mechanical part of disk operation; rather we will be focusing on general concept related to disk and algorithms to improve disk performance..</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/blog/posts/virtual-memory-mechanisms/>Virtual Memory Mechanisms</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2017-10-19 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Oct 19, 2017</time></div></div><div class=summary>As we can see in the previous post, all allocation algorithms we discussed lead to external fragmentation. As time goes by, external fragmentation is going to get worse and we need solutions for the problem. We can use swap areas to swap out memory onto the disk, or move allocated memory together(a process named memory compaction), leaving empty spaces together. Even these approaches can reduce external fragmentation and allow a higher degree of multiprogramming, they are not perfect...</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/blog/posts/virtual-memory-overview/>Virtual Memory Overview</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2017-10-08 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Oct 8, 2017</time></div></div><div class=summary>I love pointers. Pointer is very a useful feature in programming languages like C/C++. I can pass weird hexadecimal numbers to a function and then it will magically locate where the program is in memory. However, all those values we see are merely virtual addresses, a running program’s view of memory in system. Any address we can see while programming user-level programs is a virtual address. It is no more than an illusion of where the data is actually laid out in memory...</div></section><div class=pagination><span class=prev><a href=/blog/page/3/><span class=arrow>←</span> Newer posts</a></span></div></div></main><footer id=footer><div class=copyright>©
