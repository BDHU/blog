I often think, what if we write programs in a verification language, would there be much less bugs and will it make our lives much easier than sitting in front a screen for hours grinding at bugs. â€¦</p></div><p class=meta>Posted on <span class=postdate>16.

Now that the semester has ended, I decided to put down some reflections on this process. This post is not intended to be the most comprehensive CS Ph.D. application tutorial in the world, but merely a half-guide half-memoir of journey towards a PhD. Of course, you should take this post with a grain of salt, since I don&rsquo;t work on admission committees, and am no where near an expert in the application process</p></div><p class=meta>Posted on <span class=postdate>10.

Since then, its popularity has grown rapidly. However, I&rsquo;ve never actually understand what blockchain is exactly, until recently. In fact, I didn&rsquo;t really understand the difference between blockchain and bitcoin. For me, blockchain is clubbed with cryptocurrencies. So here is a short summary of what blockchain is and why people use blockchain</p></div><p class=meta>Posted on <span class=postdate>19.

Many great tutorials explains explains how to add Mathjax support to Jekyll websites. Some of them only cover Mathjax v2.
