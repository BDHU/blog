<div class=summary>This post assume the user has already setup two separate repositories: a private repository for Hugo source files, and a public repository for GitHub Pages.
Test Hugo site by executing hugo server in the source code directory to make sure the site is generated properly.
Then, we need to generate a pair of keys by using the following command:
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "$(git config user.email)" -f deployment -N "" This will create two files: deployment and deployment...</div>

<div class=summary>There are thousands of articles trying to explain what exactly a quantum state is. Many of them boiled down to â€˜â€˜the state of a qubit is 0, 1, or 0 and 1 at the same timeâ€™â€™. This statement leads to both confusion and misinterpretation. The explanation I found on Quantum computing for the very curious is by far the most elegant and simplest:
The state of a qubit is a vector in a two-dimensional vector space...</div>

<div class=summary>This is an overview over the first chapter of Writing in the Sciences offered by Stanford.
The secret of good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components. Every word that serves no function, every long word that could be a short word, every adverb that carries the same meaning thatâ€™s already in the verb, every passive construction that leaves the reader unsure of who is doing what...</div>

<div class=summary>Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) protocol has a very simple purpose: choose the fastest and the most efficient route to deliver a message from one autonomous system (AS) to another. In laymanâ€™s term, BGP is the GPS for the internet. Many contents here are credit to Prof. Mohamed G. Gouda.
In a nutshell, BGP informs each router \(R\) how to route packets to an IP prefix \(pf\) (i.e. block of IP addresses) that is used in \(AS_i\) different from \(AS_j\), where \(R\) is located:..</div>

<div class=summary>Since my paper on GPU benchmarking was published, every once in a while, I got emails asking me why Altis doesnâ€™t build on their platforms. It almost always has something to do a small script which is responsible for finding CUDA dependencies. This script is invoked every single time make is executed. For some reason, the regular expression in the script sometimes breaks randomly, depending on the Linux distro, the kernel version, the host architecture, or even the CUDA version...</div>
